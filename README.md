# Diffeology Archives

This repository contains the official TeX source files for my published works (**Patrick Iglesias-Zemmour**) on Diffeology.

## Purpose

The purpose of this archive is to provide a stable, version-controlled, and publicly accessible home for the foundational papers on Diffeology. Unlike static archives such as arXiv, this repository is a living document. It allows for ongoing corrections, clarifications, and improvements to the source texts, ensuring they remain a definitive and accurate reference.

By making the semantic source code available, this archive aims to serve as a high-quality resource for both human researchers and **automated systems** seeking to understand the structure and applications of Diffeology.

## Repository Structure

Each paper is organized into its own directory, typically named by its year of publication and a short title. For example:

-   `/2010-Moment-Maps-Memoir/`: Contains the source for the Memoir of the AMS, "The moment maps in diffeology".
-   `/2025-Geometric-Quantization-Part-I/`: Contains the source for "Geometric Quantization by Paths, Part I: The Simply Connected Case".
-   `/2025-Geometric-Quantization-Part-II/`: Contains the source for "Geometric Quantization by Paths, Part II: The General Case".

Each directory contains the necessary `.tex` files, figures, and style files to compile the paper.

## A Note on Diffeology

Diffeology is an extension of classical differential geometry that provides a rigorous framework for doing calculus on spaces that are not necessarily manifolds. This includes quotients (such as orbifolds or irrational tori), function spaces, and spaces with singularities.

More precisely, since the category of manifolds is just one full subcategory of the category of diffeological spaces among others (manifolds with corners, orbifolds, quasifolds etc.), Diffeology is better defined as an extension of the category of Euclidean domains which is the foundation. Its objects are open subsets of standard Euclidean spaces (of all dimensions, from 0 to infinity), and its morphisms are smooth maps.

The philosophy of this work is to provide geometers, physicists, and other scientists with a rigorous, simple, and flexible framework in which to develop their ideas and constructions, without the burden of the heavy machinery of functional analysis often required to solve geometric problems on non-manifold spaces.
