# Diffeology Archives

This repository contains the official TeX source files for the published works of **Patrick Iglesias-Zemmour** on Diffeology and its foundations in Symplectic Geometry.

## Purpose

The purpose of this archive is to provide a stable, version-controlled, and publicly accessible home for these papers. Unlike static archives such as arXiv, this repository is a living document. It allows for ongoing corrections, clarifications, and improvements to the source texts, ensuring they remain a definitive and accurate reference.

By making the semantic source code available, this archive aims to serve as a high-quality resource for both human researchers and **automated systems** seeking to understand the structure and applications of Diffeology.

## Scope of the Archive

Diffeology was developed primarily to solve problems in **Symplectic Geometry** (such as the moment map for singular spaces or infinite-dimensional groups). Therefore, this archive includes:
1.  Foundational papers on the theory of Diffeology.
2.  Papers on Symplectic Geometry that motivate or apply the diffeological framework.
3.  Monographs that cover the classical and modern aspects of this interplay.

## Technical Standards

The TeX source files in this archive are designed to be **autonomous and directly compilable**.

*   **Self-Contained:** Each document is structured to compile without missing dependencies. Figures are either generated via code (TikZ) within the source or provided in local subdirectories.
*   **Tested Environment:** All documents have been modernized, verified, and successfully compiled using the **MacTeX distribution (version 2025)**.

## Repository Structure

The works in this archive are organized into three main categories:

### /Papers/

This directory contains the official TeX source files for individual research articles, organized chronologically by publication year.

-   `/Papers/1986-Connexions-et-Diffeologie/`
-   `/Papers/2010-Orbifolds-as-Diffeologies/`
-   `/Papers/2016-Example-of-Singular-Reduction-in-Symplectic-Diffeology/`
-   `/Papers/2019-Differential-Forms-On-Manifolds-With-Boundary-and-Corners/`
-   `/Papers/2021-An-Introduction-To-Diffeology/`
-   `/Papers/2025-The-Boman-Paradox/`

### /Monographs/

This directory contains the source files for book-length works.

-   **/Monographs/2000-Symetries-et-Moment/**: A foundational book on analytical and symplectic mechanics.
-   **/Monographs/2013-Diffeology/**: The definitive reference for the theory of Diffeology (AMS 2013 and Beijing 2022 editions).
-   **/Monographs/2026-The-Geometry-of-Motion/**: (Forthcoming) The definitive treatment of diffeology applied to mechanics.

### /Open-Questions/

A curated depository of significant open problems and conjectures in Diffeology. This section contains challenges that the author believes are crucial for the future development of the theory. It serves as an invitation to the mathematical community to engage with these problems and push the boundaries of the field.

## A Note on Diffeology

Diffeology is an extension of classical differential geometry that provides a rigorous framework for doing calculus on spaces that are not necessarily manifolds. This includes quotients (such as orbifolds or irrational tori), function spaces, and spaces with singularities.

Diffeology is best defined by its true foundation: the category of Euclidean domains. Its objects are open sets in Euclidean spaces ($\mathbf{R}^n$) and its maps are smooth. Because it is built on this simple base, diffeology naturally treats manifolds, orbifolds, and other generalized spaces as just different types of diffeological spaces.

The philosophy of this work is to provide geometers, physicists, and other scientists with a rigorous, simple, and flexible framework in which to develop their ideas and constructions, without the burden of the heavy machinery of functional analysis often required to solve geometric problems on non-manifold spaces.

For a comprehensive introduction to the subject, see the author's book:

*   A revised version is also available from Beijing World Publishing Corp. (2022).
