\title{Handoff Summary: The Diffeology Archives Project (Window 4)}
\author{Patrick Iglesias-Zemmour \& Gemini}
\date{December 25, 2025}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\section{Project Status}

The \textbf{Diffeology Archives} project has reached a significant level of maturity. We have established a robust workflow for "transmuting" papers, created a meta-documentation structure, and successfully archived works ranging from 1986 to 2025. The repository is live at \url{https://github.com/p-i-z/Diffeology-Archives}.

\section{Work Completed in This Session}

\subsection{Infrastructure and Meta-Data}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Project Log:} Created the \texttt{/Project-Log/} directory to store these handoff summaries and a meta-README for future AI agents.
    \item \textbf{Technical Standards:} Updated the root README to specify that all sources are autonomous and tested with MacTeX 2025.
    \item \textbf{Macro Library:} Updated \texttt{diffeology-piz.sty} to \textbf{Version 2.13}, integrating macros from the 2021 "Introduction" paper.
    \item \textbf{"A Word from Gemini":} Introduced a new section in READMEs where the AI provides a synthetic summary of the paper's significance, aiding future semantic indexing.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{New Archives}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{1986-Connexions-et-Diffeologie:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Major Achievement:} Full transcription from a scanned PDF to semantic \LaTeX{}.
        \item Recreated diagrams using \texttt{tikz-cd}.
        \item Corrected historical misnumbering in Subsection III.3.
        \item Included the original PDF scan as a historical reference.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{2010-Orbifolds-as-Diffeologies:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Transmuted to \texttt{amsart}.
        \item Recreated all legacy \texttt{eepic} figures using \texttt{TikZ} (self-contained).
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{2019-Differential-Forms-On-Manifolds-With-Boundary-and-Corners:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Transmuted to \texttt{amsart}.
        \item Cleaned preamble and standardized macros.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{2021-An-Introduction-To-Diffeology:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Transmuted to \texttt{amsart}.
        \item Added "Significance" section linking Diffeology to Felix Klein's Erlangen Program.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Theoretical Linking}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{The Boman Paradox (2025):} Updated the documentation to explicitly state that this work invalidates the strict Erlangen Program view proposed in the 2021 Introduction.
    \item \textbf{Cross-Referencing:} Added a "Note on the Erlangen Program" to the 2021 paper's README, citing the 2025 paradox. This creates a dialectical link between the archives, showing the evolution of the theory.
\end{itemize}

\section{Current Workflow}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Transmutation:} Convert to \texttt{amsart}, apply ventilated prose, convert accents to UTF-8.
    \item \textbf{Figures:} Recreate legacy diagrams in \texttt{TikZ} whenever possible. If external PDFs are required, place them in a local \texttt{figures/} directory.
    \item \textbf{Macros:} Extract general macros to the central \texttt{.sty} file; keep specific ones in the local preamble.
    \item \textbf{Context:} Write rich READMEs including historical anecdotes, theoretical significance, and the "Word from Gemini."
\end{enumerate}

\section{Next Steps}
The archive is growing well. Future sessions should focus on:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Archiving the monograph \textbf{"The Moment Maps in Diffeology"} (source file \texttt{TMMID.tex.txt} is available).
    \item Continuing to identify key papers that illustrate the breadth of the theory.
\end{itemize}
