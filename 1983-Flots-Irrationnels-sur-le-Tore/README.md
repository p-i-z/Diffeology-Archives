## Summary

This paper presents the first application of the theory of diffeology, recently introduced by J.M. Souriau, to a singular geometric object that has a rrich diffeology but a trivial topology : the **irrational torus**. Using the framework of "groupes différentiels," the authors define a rigorous differential structure on the quotient space $\mathcal{T}_\alpha = T^2 / [\alpha]$, where $[\alpha]$ is the dense winding of a line with irrational slope $\alpha$ on the 2-torus.

The paper then uses this structure to compute fundamental geometric and topological properties of this new object.

## Historical Significance

This 1983 preprint represents a pivotal moment in the development of diffeology. While Souriau's initial axiomatization focused on diffeomorphisms groups, this work was the first to apply these ideas to a truly "singular" space, demonstrating the theory's power beyond its original scope.

Its key contributions to the development of the theory are:

1.  **The First Diffeological Singular Space:** The "irrational torus" served as the foundational example of a diffeological space that is not a manifold, paving the way for the study of orbifolds, function spaces, and other generalized spaces.

2.  **The Birth of "Espaces Différentiels":** This paper marks the beginning of the generalization from "diffeological groups" to "diffeological spaces." A key moment is the introduction of smooth maps between these new kinds of spaces, which were not yet formally defined. The authors themselves signal the novelty of this concept by placing the term in quotes:
    > *"Les applications diﬀérentiables de Tα à valeurs dans un "espace diﬀérentiel" E , sont les applications `$\varphi : \mathcal{T}_\alpha \to E$` telles que pour tout $`f`$ élément de `$D(\mathbf{R}^n,\mathcal{T}_\alpha)$` `$\varphi \circ f$` est un élément de `$D(\mathbf{R}^n,E)$`. En particulier les diﬀéomorphismes de `$\mathcal{T}_\alpha$` à `$E$` sont les bijections bi-diﬀérentiables."*
    
    This conceptual step was essential for building the broader theory of diffeology as it is known today.

## Key Mathematical Results

The paper establishes several fundamental results about the irrational torus $\mathcal{T}_\alpha$ as a diffeological space:

*   **Universal Covering:** The universal covering of $\mathcal{T}_\alpha$ is shown to be the real line, $\mathbf{R}$.
*   **First Homotopy Group:** The fundamental group, $\Pi_1(\mathcal{T}_\alpha)$, is computed to be $\mathbf{Z} \times \mathbf{Z}$.
*   **Classification:** It is proven that two irrational tori, $\mathcal{T}_\alpha$ and $\mathcal{T}_\beta$, are diffeomorphic if and only if $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are equivalent modulo the action of the modular group $\text{GL}(2, \mathbf{Z})$.
*   **Diffeomorphism Group:** The group of diffeomorphisms, $\text{Diff}(\mathcal{T}_\alpha)$, is fully characterized. A significant distinction emerges: the group of connected components is $\mathbb{Z}_2$ for non-quadratic irrationals, but $\mathbf{Z}_2 \times \mathbf{Z}$ for quadratic irrationals.
