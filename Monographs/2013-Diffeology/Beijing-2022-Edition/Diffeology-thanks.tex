  This book ``Diffeology'' would not have been possible without the encouragement of Yael Karshon and Fran\c{c}ois Ziegler,
  nor without the commitment of the American Mathematical Society which published it,
  its first version,
  almost ten years ago,
  in its ``Surveys and Monographs'' series.
  I thank them warmly.
  
  The studious atmosphere and the rich scientific environment of the Einstein Institute of Mathematics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem allowed me to carry out this project.
  I am sincerely grateful to them.
  The Givat Ram campus is a wonderful place where I enjoyed the friendly atmosphere as well as its peaceful and intense scientific environment.
    
  I am also pleased today to thank Enxin Wu of Shantou University and Yeqing Liu of Beijing World Publishing Corporation for taking the initiative for this (slightly revised) reprint.

%  Thanks to Yael Karshon and Fran\c{c}ois Ziegler for their encouragements to write this textbook on diffeology.\n
%  I am especially grateful to Yael Karshon for our many discussions on orbifolds and smooth structures,\n
%  and particularly for our discussions on \guillemots{symplectic diffeology} which pushed me to think seriously about this subject.\n
%    \n
%  I am very grateful to The Hebrew University of Jerusalem for its hospitality, specials thanks to  Emmanuel Farjoun for his many invitations to work there.\n
%  I started,\n
%  and mainly carried out,\n
%  this project in Jerusalem.\n
%  Without my various stays in Israel I would never have finished it.\n
%  Givat Ram campus is a wonderful place where I enjoyed the studious and friendly atmosphere,\n
%  and certainly its peaceful and intense scientific environment.\n
%  Thanks also to David Blanc from the University of Haifa, \n
%  to Misha Polyak and Yoav Moriah from the Technion,\n
%  to Misha Katz from  Bar-Ilan University,\n
%  to Leonid Polterovich and Paul Biran,\n
%  from Tel-Aviv University,\n
%  for their  \n
%  care and invitations to share my ideas with them.\n
%  Thanks also to  Yonatan Barlev,\n
%  Erez Nesrim and Daniel Shenfeld,\n
%  from the Einstein Institute,\n
%  for their participation in  the 2006 seminar on Diffeology.\n
%  Working together has been very pleasant and  their remarks have been helpful.\n
%  \n
%  Thanks to Paul Donato,\n
%  my old accomplice in diffeology,\n
%  who checked some of my claims when I needed a second guess.\n
%  Thanks also to the young guard:\n
%  Jordan Watt,\n
%  Enxin Wu and Guillaume Tahar,\n
%  their enthusiasm is refreshing and their contribution somehow significant.\n
%  Thanks also to the referee of the manuscript for his support and his clever suggestions which made me improve the content.\n
%  \n
%  %Thanks, obviously, to the CNRS that payed my salary,\n
%  %and gave me the freedom necessary to achieve this project.\n
%  %Thanks particularly to J\'er\^ome Los for his support.\n
%  \n
%  Thanks also to Liliane P\'erichaud who helped me fixing misprints,\n
%  to David Trotman who helped me to improve my English.\n
%  Thanks eventually to the AMS publishing people for their patience and care,\n
%  in particular to Jennifer Wright-Sharp for the wonderful editing job she did with the manuscript.\n
