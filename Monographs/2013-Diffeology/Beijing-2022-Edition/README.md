## About This Version

This directory contains the source code for the revised and corrected edition of the "Diffeology" monograph.

**This is the definitive and most accurate version of the text.** It is strongly recommended for all new readers, for general study, and for citation in new work.

## Summary of Corrections

This edition incorporates significant improvements over the original 2013 AMS publication:

1.  **Correction of Misprints:** Numerous typographical errors and misprints present in the first edition have been corrected throughout the text, providing a cleaner and more accurate reading experience.

2.  **Significant Mathematical Correction:** A key mathematical error concerning the kernel of morphisms has been rectified. The original text was not sufficiently clear on this point. The revised text now specifies that the discussion applies to **strong morphisms** of groupoids, particularly those that are injective on the objects.

    To support this correction and provide a rigorous foundation, the text now includes a precise reference to the foundational work on this topic:
    > G. Ivan, *Strong morphisms of groupoids*, Balkan Journal of Geometry and its Applications, 4(1), pp. 91-102, 1999.
