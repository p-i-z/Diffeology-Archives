Hence, D1, D2, D3 imply D1', D2,D3. Conversely, consider D1', D2, and D3. Let $x$ be a pointof $\X$. By D1' there exists a plot$\P : \U \to \X$ such that $x$ belongs to $\P(\U)$. Let $r$ in $\U$such that ${\P}(r) = x$. Now let $n$ be any integer. Let $\bmr: \RR^n  \to {\U}$ be the constant parametrization mapping every point of $\RR^n$to $r$. The composition ${\P} \circ \bmr$ is the constant parametrization $\bmx$ mapping $\RR^n$ to$x$. Since $\bmr$ is smooth and thanks to D3 the parametrization ${\P} \circ \bmr$ is a plot of $\X$. Hence, D1 is satisfied and D1',D2, D3 imply D1, D2, D3. Therefore, the axioms D1, D2, D3 areequivalent to the axioms D1', D2, D3.\endsolexref\solexref{Equivalent-axiom-of-locality} (Equivalent axiom of locality) Consider the three axioms D1, D2, D3\art{Diffeologies-and-diffeological-spaces}. Let ${\P}: {\U} \to {\X}$be a parametrization. Assume that for any point $r$ of${\U}$ there exists an open neighborhood ${\V}_r$ of $r$ such that${\P}_r = {\P}\restriction {\V}_r$ belongs to $\cD$. Thefamily $({\P}_r)_{r \in {\U}}$ is a compatible familyof elements of $\cD$ with ${\P}$ as supremum. Thanks tothe axiom D2, $\P$ belongs to $\cD$, and D2' issatisfied. Hence, D1, D2, D3 imply D1, D2', D3.Conversely, consider D1, D2' and D3. Now, let $\{ \P_i : \U_i \to \X \}_{i \in \cI}$ be a family ofcompatible $n$-parametrizations, and let $\P:  \U \to \X$ be the supremum of the family. Let$r$ be any point of $\U$. By definition of $\P$,there exists $\P_i: \U_i \to \X$with $r \in \U_i$ such that $\P \restriction \U_i =  \P_i$. Thus, the axiom D2' is satisfied. Hence, D1, D2',D3 imply D1, D2, D3. Therefore, the axioms D1, D2,D3 are equivalent to the axioms D1, D2', D3. \endsolexref\solexref{Global-plots-and-diffeology} (Global plots and diffeology) Let $\P : \U \to \X$ be an $n$-parametrization belonging to $\cD$. For all points $r$ in $\U$ there exists a real $\epsilon > 0$ such that the open ball $\B(r,\epsilon)$,centered at $r$, of radius $\epsilon$, is contained in $\U$. Since theinclusion $\B(r,\epsilon) \subset \U$ is a smooth parametrization, therestriction $\P \restriction \B(r,\epsilon)$ belongs to $\cD$. Now,the following parametrization $$\varphi : \B(r,\epsilon) \to \B(0,1),  \qmbox{defined by} \varphi : s \mapsto s' = {1 \over \epsilon} (s - r),  $$is a diffeomorphism.Next, let $\psi : \B(0,1) \to \RR^n$, and then $\psi^{-1} : \RR^n \to \B(0,1)$,given by$$\psi(s) = { s \over \sqrt{1 - \norm{s}^2}} \qmbox{and}  \psi^{-1}(s') = { s' \over \sqrt{1 + \norm{s'}^2}}.  $$ The parametrization $\psi$ is a diffeomorphism. Hence, $\phi = \psi \circ \varphi$ is a diffeomorphismfrom $\B(r,\epsilon)$ to $\RR^n$. Then, thanks to the axiom of smoothcompatibility, the global parametrization $(\P \restriction  \B(r,\epsilon)) \circ \phi^{-1} : \RR^n \to \X$ belongs to$\cD$. By hypothesis, it also belongs to $\cD'$.Thus, thanks again to the axiom of smoothcompatibility, the parametrization $[(\P \restriction \B(r,\epsilon))\circ \phi^{-1}] \circ \phi = \P \restriction \B(r,\epsilon)$ belongs to $\cD'$. Now, $\P$ being the supremum of a compatible family ofelements of $\cD'$, thanks to theaxiom of locality of diffeology, $\P$ is an element of $\cD'$.Therefore, $\cD \subset \cD'$, exchanging $\cD$ and $\cD'$ gives$\cD' \subset \cD$, and finally $\cD = \cD'$.\endsolexref%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% %% Smooth maps and category Diffeology%% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\SkipTocEntry\SkipTocEntry\section*{Smooth Maps and Category Diffeology}\solexref{Diffeomorphisms-between-irrational-tori}(Diffeomorphisms between irrational tori) Let $\P : \U \to \T_\alpha$ be a parametrization. Let us say that {\em$\P$ lifts locally along $\pi_\alpha$, at the point $r \in \U$\/}, if thereexist an open neighborhood $\V$ of $r$ and a smooth parametrization $\Q : \V \to \RR$ such that $\pi_\alpha \circ \Q = \P \restriction \V$. Now, the property (\blacksnow) writes: $\P$ is a plot if it lifts locally along$\pi_\alpha$, at every point of $\U$.\alinea{1)} Let us check, following \art{A-diffeology-for-the-circle},that the property (\blacksnow) defines a diffeology. \alinea{D1} --- Since $\pi_\alpha$ is surjective, for every point $\tau \in \T_\alpha$ there exists $x \in \RR$ such that $\tau = \pi_\alpha(r)$.Then, $\bmx : r \mapsto x$ is a lift in $\RR$ of the constant parametrization $\btau : r \mapsto \tau$.\alinea{D2} --- The axiom of locality is satisfied by the very definition of $\cD$.\alinea{D3} --- Let $\P : \U \to \T_\alpha$ satisfying (\blacksnow). Let $\F : \U'  \to \U$ be a smooth para\-met\-ri\-za\-tion. Let $r'$ be a point of $\U'$, let$r = \F(r')$, let $\V$ be an open neighborhood of $r$ and $\Q$ be a smoothparametrization in $\RR$ such that $\pi_\alpha \circ \Q = \P  \restriction \V$. Let $\V' = \F^{-1}(\V)$ and $\Q' = \Q \circ \F$,defined on $\V'$. Then, $\pi_\alpha \circ \Q' = (\P \circ \F) \restriction \V'$.  \alinea{2)} Let us consider $f \in \Cinfty(\T_\alpha,\RR)$. Since $\pi_\alpha$and $f$ are smooth, the map $\F = f \circ \pi_\alpha$belongs to $\Cinfty(\RR,\RR)$\art{composition-of-smooth-maps}. But since$\pi_\alpha(x + n + \alpha m) = \pi_\alpha(x)$, for every$n,m$ in $\ZZ$, we also have $\F(x + n + \alpha m) = \F(x)$. Hence, $\F$ is smooth and constant on a densesubset of numbers $\ZZ + \alpha \ZZ \subset \RR$ (for $x = 0$). Thus,$\F$ is constant and therefore $f$ is constant. In otherwords, $\Cinfty(\T_\alpha,\RR) = \RR$.\alinea{3)} Let us consider a smooth map $f : \T_\alpha \to \T_\beta$. Note that, since $\pi_\alpha$ satisfiesobviously (\blacksnow), $\pi_\alpha$ is a plot of$\T_\alpha$. Then, by definition of differentiability\art{Smooth-maps}, $f \circ \pi_\alpha$ is aplot of $\T_\beta$. Hence, for every real $x_0$ thereexist an open neighborhood $\V$ of $x_0$ and a smoothparametrization $\F : \V \to \RR$ such that $\pi_\beta \circ \F = (f \circ \pi_\alpha) \restriction \V$. Since $\V$ is an open subset of $\RR$ containing $x_0$, we canchoose $\V$ as an interval centered at $x_0$. For allreal numbers $x$ and all pairs $(n,m)$ of integers suchthat $x + n + \alpha m$ belongs to $\V$, the identity$\pi_\beta \circ \F = (f \circ \pi_\alpha) \restriction \V$ writes  $\pi_\beta \circ \F(x + n + \alpha m)  = f \circ \pi_\alpha(x + n + \alpha m) = f \circ \pi_\alpha(x) = \pi_\beta \circ \F(x)$. Thus, there exist two integers $n'$ and $m'$ such that\begin{equation}  \renewcommand{\theequation}{$\spadesuit$}  \F(x + n + \alpha m) = \F(x) + n' + \beta m'.\end{equation} Since $\beta$ is irrational, for every such $x$, $n$ and $m$, the pair $(n',m')$ is unique.%There exists an interval $\cJ \subset \V$ centered at $x_0$ and aninterval $\cO$ centered at $0$ such that for every $x \in \cJ$ and forevery $n + \alpha m \in \cO$, $x + n + \alpha m \in \V$. Since $\F$ iscontinuous and since $\ZZ + \alpha \ZZ$ is totally discontinuous, $n' +  \beta m' = \F(x + n + \alpha m) - \F(x)$ is constant as function of$x$. But $\F$ is smooth, the derivative of the identity ($\spadesuit$),with respect to $x$, at the point $x_0$, gives $\F'(x_0 + n + \alpha m)  = \F'(x_0)$. Then, since $\alpha$ is irrational, $\ZZ + \alpha \ZZ \cap    \cO$ is dense in $\cO$ and since $\F'$ is continuous, $\F'(x) =      \F'(x_0)$,  for all $x \in \cJ$. Hence, $\F$ restricted to $\cJ$ isaffine, there exist two numbers $\lambda$ and $\mu$ such that \begin{equation}  \renewcommand{\theequation}{$\clubsuit$}  \F(x) = \lambda x + \mu \qmbox{for all} x \in \cJ.\end{equation} Note that, by density of $\ZZ +  \alpha \ZZ$, $\pi_\alpha(\cJ) = \T_\alpha$. Hence $\F$defines completely the function $f$.Now, applying $(\spadesuit)$ to the expression $(\clubsuit)$ of $\F$, weget for all $n + \alpha m \in \cO$\begin{equation}  \renewcommand{\theequation}{$\diamondsuit$}  \lambda \times (n + \alpha  m ) \in \ZZ + \beta \ZZ. \end{equation}Let us show that actually $(\diamondsuit)$ is satisfied for all $n + \alpha m$ in $\ZZ + \alpha \ZZ$. Let $\cO = ]-a,a[$, and let us take$a$ not in $\ZZ + \alpha \ZZ$, even if we have to shorten $\cO$ a little bit. Let $x \in \ZZ + \alpha \ZZ$, and $x >a$. There exists $\N \in \NN$ such that $0 < (\N-1)a < x < \N a$, and then $0< x/\N < a$.Now, by density of $\ZZ + \alpha \ZZ$ in $\RR$, for all $\eta >0$there exists $y \in \ZZ + \alpha \ZZ$ such that $0 < x/\N - y < \eta$.Choosing $\eta < a/\N$ we have $0 < x - \N y < \N \eta < a$, and $0 < y < x/\N < a$. Thus, since $x - \N y \in \ZZ + \alpha \ZZ \cap \cO$,$\lambda \times (x- \N y) = \lambda x - \N \times (\lambda y) \in \ZZ + \beta \ZZ$. But $y \in  \ZZ + \alpha \ZZ \cap \cO$, thus $\lambda y \in \ZZ + \beta \ZZ$, and then $\N \times (\lambda y) \in \ZZ + \beta \ZZ$,therefore $\lambda x \in \ZZ + \beta \ZZ$.Now, applying successively $(\diamondsuit)$ to $\alpha$ and $1$, we get$\lambda \alpha \in \ZZ + \beta \ZZ$ and $\lambda \in \ZZ + \beta \ZZ$.Let $\lambda \alpha = a + \beta b$ and $\lambda = c + \beta d$. If$\lambda \neq 0$, then $\alpha = (a + \beta b) / (c + \beta d)$.\alinea{4)} Let us remark first that, since$\pi_\alpha(\cJ) = \T_\alpha$, the map $\F$, extended to the whole$\RR$, still satisfies $\pi_\beta \circ \F = f \circ \pi_\alpha$. Now,let us assume that $f$ is bijective. Note that $f$ surjective isequivalent to $\lambda \neq 0$. Let us express that $f$ isinjective: let $\tau = \pi_\alpha(x)$ and  $\tau' = \pi_\alpha(x')$,if  $f(\tau) = f(\tau')$, then $\tau = \tau'$, that is, $x' = x + n +  \alpha m$, for some relative integers $n$ and $m$. Using the lifting$\F$, this is equivalent to: if there exist two integers$n'$ and $m'$ such that $\F(x') = \F(x) + n' + \beta m'$, then thereexist two integers $n$ and $m$ such that  $x' = x + n + \alpha m$. But $\F(x) = \lambda x + \mu$, with $\lambda \times (\ZZ + \alpha \ZZ) \subset \ZZ + \beta \ZZ$. Hence, the injectivity writes: if$\lambda x' + \mu = \lambda x + \mu + n' + \beta m'$, then $x' = x + n + \alpha m$, which is equivalent to: if $\lambda y \in \ZZ + \beta \ZZ$,then $y \in \ZZ + \alpha \ZZ$, and finally equivalent to $(1/\lambda) \times (\ZZ + \beta \ZZ) \subset \ZZ + \alpha \ZZ$. Now, let us consider the multiplication by $\lambda$, asa $\ZZ$-linear map, from the $\ZZ$-module $\ZZ + \alpha  \ZZ$ to  the $\ZZ$-module $\ZZ + \beta \ZZ$, defined inthe respective bases $(1,\alpha)$ and $(1, \beta)$, by$$\lambda \times 1 = c + d \times \beta \qmbox{and}  \lambda \times \alpha = a + b \times \beta.$$ The two modules being identified, by their bases, to $\ZZ \times \ZZ$, the multiplication by $\lambda$ and themultiplication by $1/\lambda$ are represented by thematrices $$ \lambda \simeq \L = \begin{pmatrix}c & a \\ d & b\end{pmatrix} \qmbox{and} {1 \over \lambda} \simeq  \L^{-1}.$$ Thus, the matrix $\L$ is invertible as a matrix withcoefficients in $\ZZ$, that is, $\L = \GL(2,\ZZ)$, or $ad - bc = \pm 1$.    \endsolexref\solexref{Smooth-maps-on-R/Q} (Smooth maps on $\RR/\QQ$)  This exercise is similar to the\exref{Diffeomorphisms-between-irrational-tori}, with solution above.\alinea{1)} Let us consider a smooth map $f : \E_\QQ \to \E_\QQ$.Since $\pi : \RR \to \E_\QQ$ is a plot, bydefinition of differentiability \art{Smooth-maps}, $f \circ \pi$ also is a plot of $\E_\QQ$. Hence, for every real$x_0$ there exist an open neighborhood $\V$ of $x_0$ and a smoothparametrization $f : \V \to \RR$ such that $\pi \circ \F = (f \circ \pi) \restriction \V$. Since $\V$ is an open subset of $\RR$ containing $x_0$, we can choose  $\V$ to be an interval centered at $x_0$. For every real number $x$ and every rational number $q$ such that $x + q$ belongs to $\V$, the identity $\pi \circ \F = (f \circ \pi) \restriction \V$writes  $\pi \circ \F(x + q)  = f \circ \pi(x + q) = f \circ \pi(x) = \pi \circ \F(x)$. Thus, there exists a rational number $q'$ such that $\F(x + q) = \F(x) + q'$.The rational number $q' = \F(x + q) - \F(x)$ is smooth in $x$and $q$, thus constant in $x$ (see also\exref{Diffeology-of-Q-in-R}). Hence, taking thederivative of this identity, at thepoint $x_0$, with respect to $x$, we get $\F(x_0 + q) = \F'(x_0)$. Let usdenote $\lambda = \F'(x_0)$. Now, according to thecontinuity of $\F$ and the density of $\QQ$ in $\RR$, we have $\F(x) = \lambda x + \mu$, where $\mu \in \RR$. {\em A priori\/} $\F$ is defined on a smaller neighborhood $\W \subset \V$ of$x_0$, but by density of $\QQ$ in $\RR$ weget, as in \exref{Diffeomorphisms-between-irrational-tori},$\pi(\W) = \E_\QQ$. Thus, $\F$ can be extended to thewhole $\RR$ by the affine map $x \mapsto \lambda x + \mu$. Now, coming back to the condition $\F(x + q) = \F(x) + q'$, we get $\lambda (x + q) + \mu = \lambda x + \mu + q'$, that is, $\lambda q = q'$. Thus, $\lambda$ issome number mapping any rational number into another, hence itis a rational number. Let us denote it by $q$. Therefore, the map$f$ being defined by $\pi \circ \F = f \circ \pi$, weget $f(\tau) = q \tau + \tau'$, where $\tau' = \pi(\mu)$. Hence, any smooth map from $\E_\QQ$ to $\EE_\QQ$ is affine. Note that $f$ is a diffeomorphism if and only if $q \neq 0$.\alinea{2)} With similar arguments as in the first question, we can check thatany smooth map $f : \T_\alpha \to \E_\QQ$ is theprojection of an affine map $\F : x \mapsto \lambda x + \mu$. But $\F$ needs to satisfy the condition $\F(x + n + \alpha m) = \F(x) + q$, where $n$ and $m$ areintegers and $q$ is a rational number. In particular, for $n = 1$ and  $m = 0$, this gives  $\lambda \in \QQ$, and for$n=0$ and $m = 1$, $\lambda \alpha \in \QQ$. But since$\alpha \in \RR - \QQ$, this is satisfied only for$\lambda = 0$. And finally $\F$ is constant.\alinea{3)} The identity $\Cinfty(\E_\QQ,\RR) = \RR$ is analogous to$\Cinfty(\T_\alpha,\RR) = \RR$ of the second question of\exref{Diffeomorphisms-between-irrational-tori}. The second part of thequestion is similar to  the second question of this exercise, inverting$\QQ$ and $\ZZ + \alpha \ZZ$. The map $\F$ is affine, $\F : x \mapsto  \lambda x + \mu$, and for every $q \in \QQ$, there exist two numbers$n,m \in \ZZ$ such that $\F(x + q) = \F(x) + n + \alpha m$. So, we get$\lambda q = n + \alpha m$. In particular, for $q = 1$, we get that$\lambda = a + \alpha b$, where $a,b \in \ZZ$. Hence, for any rational number$q$, $(a + \alpha b) q = n + \alpha m$, that is, $aq + bq \alpha = n +  \alpha m$, or $(aq - n) + (bq - m) \alpha = 0$. Since $\alpha \in \RR -    \QQ$, we get, for all $q \in \QQ$, $aq \in \ZZ$ and $bq \in \ZZ$. Butthis implies that $a$ and $b$ are divisible by any integer, thus $a =0$ and $b = 0$, and therefore $\lambda = 0$. \endsolexref\solexref{Smooth-maps-on-spaces-of-maps}(Smooth maps on spaces of maps)  We shal denote here thederivation map $d/dx^k$ by $\phi_k$.\alinea{1)} The map $\phi_k : \Cinfty(\RR) \to \Cinfty(\RR)$ issmooth if and only if, for every plot $\P : \U \to \Cinfty(\RR)$, the parametrization $\phi_k \circ \P$ is aplot of $\Cinfty(\RR)$. According to the definition ofthe functional diffeology of $\Cinfty(\RR)$\art{A-diffeology-for-the-sets-of-smooth-maps}, the parametrization$\phi_k \circ \P$ is a plot of $\Cinfty(\RR)$ if and only if theparametrization $(r,x) \mapsto (\phi_k \circ \P (r))(x)$ is a smoothparametrization of $\RR$, that is, if the parametrization $$  \psi_k : (r,x) \mapsto \bigg[{d^k \over dx^k}(\P(r))\bigg](x)  $$is smooth. But $\psi_k$ is the $k$-partial derivative, with respectto $x$, of the parametrization $\PP : (r,x) \mapsto \P(r)(x)$,$$  \psi_k(r,x) = {\partial^k \PP \over \partial x^k}(r,x).  $$Since, by the very definition of the plots of $\Cinfty(\RR)$\art{A-diffeology-for-the-sets-of-smooth-maps}, the parametrization$\PP$ is smooth, allof its partial derivatives are smooth. They are smooth with respect tothe pair of variables $(r,x)$, by the very definition of the class$\Cinfty$. Therefore, $\psi_k$ is smooth and $d^k/dx^k$ is asmooth map from $\Cinfty(\RR)$ to itself.\alinea{2)} The map $\hat x$ is smooth if and only if, for everyplot $\P : \U \to \Cinfty(\RR)$, the parametrization$\hat x \circ \P : r \mapsto \P(r)(x)$ is smooth. But,by the very definition of the functional diffeology\art{A-diffeology-for-the-sets-of-smooth-maps}, theparametrization $\PP : (r,x) \mapsto \P(r)(x)$ issmooth. Since the map $\hat x \circ \P$ is thecomposition $\PP \circ j_x$, where $j_x$ is the (smooth)inclusion $j_x : r \mapsto (r,x)$ from $\U$ to $\U  \times \RR$, the parametrization $\hat x \circ \P$ issmooth and $\hat x$ belongs to $\Cinfty(\Cinfty(\RR), \RR)$. %Now, note that for every integer $k$, the map $f \mapsto f^{(k)}(x)$ isjust $$f \mapsto f^{(k)} \mapsto \hat x(f^{(k)}) = \bigg[\hat x \circ  {d^k \over dx^k}\bigg](f),$$ that is, the composition of two smooth maps, therefore it is smooth\art{composition-of-smooth-maps}. \noindent Hence, each componentof the map $$ \D_x^k : f \mapsto \bigg(\hat x(f), \bigg(  \hat x \circ {d \over dx} \bigg)(f), \ldots, \bigg( \hat  x \circ {d^k \over dx^k} \bigg)(f)\bigg) $$ is smooth, from $\Cinfty(\RR)$ to $\RR$, and$\D_x^k : \Cinfty(\RR) \to \RR^{k+1}$ is smooth.\alinea{3)} From differential calculus in $\RR^n$ we know that, for all$f \in \Cinfty(\RR)$, the map $$ \F :  x \mapsto \int_0^x f(t) dt $$is continuous and smooth, with $f$ as derivative. Since $\F$ is continuous and $\F' = f$ is smooth, theprimitive $\F$ is smooth. Now, $\I_{a,b}(f) = \F(b) - \F(a)$. To prove that $\I_{a,b}$ is smooth we have justto check that the map $\I : f \mapsto \F$ is smooth. Let$\P : \U \to \Cinfty(\R)$ be a plot, we have $$\I \circ \P(r) = x \mapsto \int_0^x \P(r)(t) dt = \int_0^x \PP(r,t) dt \qmbox{with} \PP(r,x) = \P(r)(x).$$ Now, $\I \circ \P$ is a plot of $\Cinfty(\RR)$ if and only if theparametrization $(r,x) \mapsto (\I \circ \P(r))(x)$ issmooth, that is, if and only if the parametrization $$  \cP : (r,x) \mapsto \int_0^x\PP(r,t)\, dt$$ is smooth.But, by the very definition of the functional diffeologyof $\Cinfty(\RR)$, the parametrization $\PP$ is smooth.Thus, since the partial derivatives of $\PP$ with respect tothe variables $r$ commute with the integration,on the one hand we have$$ {\partial^n \over \partial r^n}\cP(r,x) =  \int_0^x {\partial^n \over \partial r^n}\PP(r,t)\, dt.$$ On the other hand, since the partial derivatives of $\PP$,with respect to $r$ or $x$, commute, we have, for $m \geq 1$ $$ {\partial^n \partial^m \over \partial r^n    \partial x^m}\cP(r,x) = {\partial^n \over \partial    r^n}\bigg[{\partial^m \over \partial x^m} \int_0^x    \PP(r,t)\, dt \bigg] = {\partial^n \over \partial r^n}    {\partial^{m-1} \over \partial x^{m-1}} \PP(r,x). $$Therefore, the parametrization $\cP$ is smooth and $\I, \I_{a,b} \in \Cinfty(\Cinfty(\RR))$.\alinea{4)} Checking that the condition \xart{A-diffeology-for-the-sets-of-smooth-maps}{($\diamondsuit$)} defines a diffeology isstraightforward. The same arguments as for\art{A-diffeology-for-the-circle} can be used, or thegeneral construction of subset diffeology, described in\art{Subspaces-and-subset-diffeology}. Now, the derivative issmooth and, restricted to$\Cinfty_0(\RR)$, is injective. The derivative also is surjectivesince $\F : x \mapsto \int_0^x f(t)\, dt$ satisfies $\F' = f$ and $\F(0) = 0$. The inverse of $d/dx$ is justthe map $\I$ defined in the previous paragraph.Since we have seen that $\I$ is smooth, thederivative is a diffeomorphism. Moreover, it is a lineardiffeomorphism.\endsolexref %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% %% Comparing diffeologies%% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\SkipTocEntry\section*{Comparing Diffeologies}\solexref{Locally-constant-parametrizations}(Locally constant parametrizations) Let us first assume that $\P : \U \to \X$ is locallyconstant. Let $r$ and $r'$ be two connected points in $\U$and $\gamma$ be a path connecting $r$ to $r'$, that is,$\gamma \in \Cinfty(\RR,\U)$ with $\gamma(0)= r$ and$\gamma(1) = r'$. \alinea{a)} The parametrization $p = {\P} \circ \gamma$ is locally constant. Indeed, let $t \in \RR$ be any point andlet $r = \gamma(t)$. Since $\P$ is locally constant, there exists an open neighborhood $\V$ of $r$ such that $\P \restriction \V$ is a constantparametrization. Since $\gamma$ is smooth, thus continuous,$\W = \gamma^{-1}(\V)$ is a domain and $p \restriction \W =  \P \circ  \gamma \restriction \gamma^{-1}(\V)$ is constant. \alinea{b)} The segment $[0,1]$ can be covered with a family ofopen intervals such that $p$ is constant on each of them. Since$[0,1]$ is compact, there exists a finitesubcovering $\{{\I}_{k}\}_{k = 1}^{\N}$ of $[0,1]$ such that:$[0,1]\subset \bigcup_{k = 1}^{\N} {\I}_{k}$ and for all $k = 1\ldots  {\N}$, $p\restriction {\I}_{k} = \const$. Now,there exists an interval ${\I} \in \{{\I}_{k}\}_{k = 1}^{\N}$ such that$0 \in {\I}$. Let $\cI_1$ be the union of all the intervals of the family$\{{\I}_{k}\}_{k = 1}^{\N}$ whose intersection with ${\I}$ is notempty. Since $\cI_1$ is a union of open intervals containing $0$, itis itself an open interval containing $0$. If $\cI_1 = {\I}$, then thefamily was reduced to $\{{\I}\}$ and we are done: $\I$ contains $0$ and$1$ and $p \restriction \I$ is constant. Now, let us assume that $\cI_1  \neq {\I}$. Note first that $p\restriction \cI_1$ is constant with value$p(0)$. Indeed, for every interval $\I_k$ containing $0$,$p\restriction \I_k = [t \mapsto p(0)]$. Hence, replacing all theintervals $\I_k$ containing $0$ by $\cJ_1$, we get a newfinite covering of $[0,1]$ satisfying the same conditions as theprevious one, but with a number of elements strictly less than ${\N}$.Thus, after a finite number of steps we get a covering of $[0,1]$ madewith a unique open interval on which $p$ is constant. Therefore,$p(0) = p(1)$. \alinea{c)} Conversely, let us assume that $\P$ is constant onevery connected component of $\U$. Let $r_0 \in \U$,since $\U$ is open, there exists an open ball$\B$ centered at $r_0$ and contained in $\U$.But, since $\B$ is path connected and contains $r_0$,$\B$ is contained in the connected component of $r_0$ in$\U$.

Let us assume that $\P$ is not locally constant at thepoint $r$, that is, there exists a small ball $\B$, centered at $r$,which does not contain any ball $\B'$, centered at $r$, on which$\P$ would be constant. Hence, there exists $r' \in \B$ with$r'\neq r$ such that $q \neq q'$, where $q' = \P(r')$. Next, let $f: t \mapsto r+ t(r'-r)$, which can be defined on an open neighborhood of$[0,1]$. The map $f$ sends $[0,1]$ onto the segment $[r,r']$, $f([0,1]) \subset \B$. Thus, $\Q = \P \circ f$ is a real continuousfunction mapping $[0,1]$ onto $[q,q']$, with $\Q(0) = q$ and $\Q(1) = q'$. By the intermediate value theorem, $f$ takes all the realvalues between $q$ and $q'$. But there is always an irrational numberbetween two distinct rational numbers. This contradicts the hypothesis that$f$ takes only rational values. Therefore, there is no such plot $\P$, and the only plots of $\RR$ which take their values in $\QQ$ are locally constant. %We observe that we can replace $\QQ$ by any countable subset, the intermediate value theorem will continue to apply. Let then $\A \subset \U$ be a countable subset of an $n$-domain, the composition of anyplot $\P$ of $\A$ with the $n$ coordinate projections $\pr_k : \U \to \RR$is a plot of $\RR$ taking its values in a countable subset, so locally constant.

Now, since therank of smooth maps between real domains issemi-continuous below, $\rank(f)_r = n$ on some open neighborhoodof $r$. Thus, by application of the rank theorem(look, for example \cite[10.3.1]{Die70a}) thereexist an open neighborhood $\cO$ of $r$, an open neighborhood$\cO'$ of $f(r)$, a diffeomorphism $\varphi$ from theopen unit ball of $\RR^n$ to $\cO$, mapping $0$ to $r$,and a diffeomorphism $\psi$ from the open unit ball of$\RR^m$ to $\cO'$, mapping $0$ to $f(r)$, such that $f \circ \varphi = \psi \circ j$,where $j : \RR^n \to \RR^m$ is the canonical inductionfrom $\RR^n$ to $\RR^m$$j(r_1,\ldots,r_n) = (r_1,\ldots,r_n,0,\ldots,0)$.Hence, $f \restriction \cO$ is conjugate toan induction by two diffeomorphisms.

Next, since $f$ isflat, for all integers $p$ we have\begin{equation}  \renewcommand{\theequation}{$\diamondsuit$}  \lim_{t \mathop{\rightarrow} 0^\pm}  {f(t) \over t^p} = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \lim_{t \mathop{\rightarrow} 0^\pm}{\F(t) \over t^p} = 0,\end{equation}in particular for $p=1$. Thus, $\F$ is derivable at $0$ and$\F'(0) = 0$.

Now, composing withtwo translations at the source and at the target, thesame proof applies for every point $t \in \openinterval{-\varepsilon,+\varepsilon}$, and for every value$f(t)$.

But since $\gamma$ isinjective, these two cases are mutually exclusive.Without loss of generality, we can assume that$\gamma(\openinterval{-\varepsilon,0}) \subset \set{x \ee_1  \mid x>0}$ and $\gamma(\openinterval{0,-\varepsilon}) \subset    \set{y \ee_2 \mid y>0}$. Thus, for all $p>0$, $\lim_{t \mathop{\rightarrow} 0^-} \gamma^{(p)}(t) = \alpha \ee_1$     and $\lim_{t \mathop{\rightarrow} 0^+} \gamma^{(p)}(t) = \beta \ee_2$. Hence, by continuity,$\alpha = \beta = 0$. Therefore, $\gamma$ is flat at$0$. Now, if $\gamma$ is not assumed to be injective,then the parametrization $\gamma : t \to t^2 \ee_1$ issmooth, not flat, and satisfies $\gamma(0) = 0$.\alinea{1.B} -- If $0 \in \RR$ is not an isolated zero of$\gamma$, then there exists a sequence $t^0_1 <  \cdots < t^0_n < \cdots$ of numbers, converging to $0$,such that $\gamma(t^0_n) = 0$. The fact that $\gamma$is flat at $0$ is the consequence of the lemma of\exref{Flat-points-of-smooth-paths}. \alinea{2)} First of all $j$ is injective. Since therestriction of $j$ on $\openinterval{-\infty, 0} \cup  \openinterval{0,+\infty}$ is smooth, the only problem is for$t = 0$. But the succesive derivatives of $j$ write$$  j^{(p)}(t) = \vect{ q_-(t)\, e^{1 \over t} \\ 0}   \mbox{ if $t < 0$}, \qmbox{and}   j^{(p)}(t) = \vect{ 0 \\ q_+(t)\, e^{-{1 \over t}}}   \mbox{ if $t > 0$},  $$where $q_\pm$ are two rational fractions. Then,$$  \lim_{t \mathop{\rightarrow} 0^\pm} q_\pm(t) \,  e^{-{1 \over \modulus{t}}} = 0, \qmbox{thus}  \lim_{t \mathop{\rightarrow} 0^\pm} j^{(p)}(0) =   \vect{0 \\ 0}.  $$Therefore, $j$ is smooth.\alinea{3)} Let $\abs$ denote the map $t \mapsto \modulus{t}$. The map$j \circ \abs$ is smooth but not $\abs$. But, for aninjection,  to be an induction means that for aparametrization $\P$, $j \circ \P$ is smooth if and onlyif $\P$ is smooth. Thus, if $j$ is a smooth injection, itis not an induction.

First of all,since the vectors $b_1, \ldots , b_k$ are free, the map$\cB$ is injective. Then, since $\cB$ is linear, $\cB$ issmooth from $\RR^k$ to $\RR^n$. Now, let $\P : \U \to  \RR^n$ be a smooth parametrization of $\RR^n$, withvalues in $\E = \cB(\RR^k)$.

Hence,$\cB^{-1} \circ \P = \M \circ \P$. Since $\M \circ \P$ issmooth, $\cB^{-1} \circ \P$ is smooth and $\cB$ is aninduction.

By definition ofthe diffeology of $\T_\alpha$, this parametrization isa surjective plot of $\T_\alpha$. Now, by density of$\ZZ + \alpha \ZZ$ in $\RR$, any open interval around $0 \in \RR$contains always a representative of every orbit of $\ZZ + \alpha \ZZ$.Hence, the plot $\pi_\alpha$ is not locally constant. Therefore, sincea diffeology is discrete \art{Discrete-diffeology} if and only if allits plots are locally constant, \art{To-be-a-locally-constant-map}, thediffeology of $\T_\alpha$ is not discrete. Now let $\tau \in \T_\alpha$ and $x \in \RR$ such that $\pi_\alpha(x) = \tau$. Let $\P : \U \to \T_\alpha - \tau$ be a plot, thus $\P$ is a plot of $\T_\alpha$ such that$\tau \not \in \Val(\P)$.

Let $x_0 = \Q(r_0)$, $x_1 = \Q(r_1)$, and let us assume that$x_0 \leq x_1$, it would be equivalent to assume $x_0  \geq x_1$. Since $\Q$ is smooth, {\em a fortiori\/} continuous,   the interval $\left[x_0,x_1\right]$ is contained in$\Val(\Q)$.

Therefore the plot$\P$ is locally constant, and this is the definition for$f(\RR)$ to be discrete. It follows that $f$ is notsmooth, since it is not locally constant, andtherefore not a plot. But note that $f$ is a plot forthe diffeology defined only by ($\clubsuit$).\alinea{3)} for $\Cinfty(\RR^n)$, the condition ($\spadesuit$) mustbe replaced by the following:\begin{itemize}  \item[($\spadesuit$)] For any $r_0 \in \U$ there exists an  open ball $\Ball$, centered at $r_0$, and for every  $r \in \B$ there exists a  compact $\K \subset \RR^n$   such that  $\P(r)$ and $\P(r_0)$ coincide outside $\K$. \end{itemize} Now, for the same kind of reason as for the second question, theinjection $j : \GL(n,\RR) \to \Cinfty(\RR^n, \RR^n)$ has adiscrete image, and is not smooth.

Let usassume that $\varphi(0) \neq 0$. Since $\varphi$ isbijective, there exists a point $x_0 > 0$ such that$\varphi(x_0) =0$. Hence, there exists a closed intervalcentered at $x_0$,  let us say $\I = [x_0 -  \varepsilon,x_0 + \varepsilon]$, $\varepsilon >0$, suchthat $f = \varphi \restriction \I$ is positive,injective, continuous, and maps $x_0$ to $0$. Let $a = f(x_0 - \varepsilon)$ and $b = f(x_0 + \varepsilon)$. We have $a >0$ and $b>0$, let us assume that $0 < a \leq b$ (it is not crucial). Now, since $f$ is continuous,maps $0$ to $0$, and $x_0 + \varepsilon$ to $b$, for every point $y$ between $0$ and $b$ there exists apoint  $x$ between $0$ and $x_0 + \varepsilon$ such that$f(x) = y$, and since $0 < a \leq b$, there exists $x_1 \in [0, x_0 + \varepsilon]$ such that $f(x_1) = a$.Thus, $a = f(x_0 - \varepsilon) = f(x_1)$ and $x_1 \neq x_0 - \varepsilon$. This is impossible, by hypothesis$f$ is injective. Hence, $\varphi(0) = 0$. Therefore, the set $\set{0}$ is an orbit of $\Diff([0,\infty[)$, thatis a Klein stratum.Next, since $\varphi(0) = 0$, $\varphi(]0,\infty[) =\, ]0,\infty[$. Let $f = \varphi \restriction\, ]0,\infty[$, $f$ is bijective,smooth and its inverse is also smooth.Thus, $f$ is a diffeomorphism of $]0,\infty[$, andmoreover $\lim_{x \mathop{\rightarrow} 0} = 0$. Let us now try toconvince ourselves that any point $x$ of $]0,\infty[$can be mapped to any point $y$ of $]0,\infty[$ by adiffeomorphism $\varphi$ of $[0,\infty[$. Let us assumethat $0 < x \leq y$. I claim that there exist a number$\varepsilon > 0$, and a diffeomorphism $f$ of$]0,\infty[$ such that $f \restriction \,  ]0, \varepsilon[$ is equal to the identity, and $f(x) = y$, see \fig{fig-diffeo-0-infty}. %%###########\begin{figure}[tb]  \centerline{\includegraphics{Figures-PDF/fig-diffeo-0-infty.pdf}}  \caption{The diffeomorphism $f$.}  \label{fig-diffeo-0-infty} \end{figure}%%########### The extension $\varphi$ of $f$ to$[0,\infty[$ defined by $\varphi(0) = 0$ is a diffeomorphism of$[0,\infty[$, got by gluing the identity on someinterval $[0,\varepsilon[$ with$f$.

Now, a plot $\P : \U \to \RR$ ofthe functional diffeology of $\Cinfty(\RR,\RR)$ foliatedby the relation $\sim$ is a plot of thefunctional diffeology of $\Cinfty(\RR,\RR)$ which takes locally its values in some class of $\sim$.

Hence, except forthe plots with negative values (which are locally constant), every plot is locally the square of a smooth parametrization of$\R$. Therefore, every plot of $\cD$ is a plot of thesmooth diffeology $\Cinfty_\star(\RR)$ of $\RR$, thus$\cD$ is finer than $\Cinfty_\star(\RR)$. \alinea{1)} Let $\P : \U \to \RR$ be a plot for $\cD$. Let $r_0  \in \U$ such that $\P(r_0) < 0$. Since $\P(r_0)$ does notbelong to the set of values of $\sq$, by application ofthe characterization of theplots of pushforwards ofdiffeologies \art{Pushforward-of-diffeologies}, $\P$ islocally constant around $r_0$. In particular, thereexists an open ball $\B$ centered at $r_0$ such that $\P  \restriction \B$ is constant.\alinea{2)} Let $\P : \U \to \RR$ be a plot for $\cD$. Let $r_0  \in \U$ such that $\P(r_0) > 0$. Since $\P(r_0)$ is inthe set of values of $\sq$, there exists a smoothparametrization $\Q$ of $\RR$, defined on an open neighborhood$\V$ of $r_0$ such that $\P(r) = \Q(r)^2$. Now, since$\P(r_0) > 0$, there exists an open ball $\B$ centeredat $r_0$ such that $\P \restriction \B$ is strictlypositive. Hence, $\Q \restriction \B$ does not vanish,thus $\Q$ keeps a constant sign on $\B$ and the map$\sqrt{\P} : r \mapsto \modulus{\Q(r)}$, defined on $\B$,is smooth.\alinea{3)} If $\P(r_0) = 0$, then there exist an open neighborhood $\V$ of$r_0$ and a smooth parametrization $\Q : \V \to \RR$such that $\P \restriction \V = \Q^2$. But $\P(r_0) = 0$implies $\Q(r_0) = 0$. Thus,$\D(\P)(r_0) = 2 \Q(r_0)\times\D(\Q)(r_0) = 0$. Hence, the first derivative of $\P$ vanishes at $r_0$. Let $u$ and $v$ be two vectors of $\RR^n$, with $n = \dim(\P)$,\begin{eqnarray*}  \D^2(\P)(r_0)(u)(v) &=& \D[r \mapsto 2  \Q(r)\times\D(\Q)(r)(u)](r_0)(v) \\   &=& 2 \D(\Q)(r_0)(v)\times\D(\Q)(r_0)(u) + 2  \Q(r_0)\times \D^2(\Q)(r_0)(u)(v)\\  &=& 2 \D(\Q)(r_0)(v)\times \D(\Q)(r_0)(u) \quad  \mbox{(since $\Q(r_0) = 0$)}.\end{eqnarray*} Thus, since $\H(v)(v) = 2[\D(\Q)(r_0)(v)]^2$, the Hessian$\H = \D^2(\P)(r_0)$ is positive. \alinea{4)} Since $f(x) = (x \sqrt{1-x})^2$, and $\sqrt{1-x}$ issmooth on $]-\infty, 1[$, $x \sqrt{1-x}$ is smooth,and $f$ is a plot of $\cD$. \endsolexref%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% %% Subductions%% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\SkipTocEntry\section*{Subductions}\solexref{Subduction-onto-the-circle}(Subduction onto the circle)First of all, note that the map $\Pi : t \mapsto  (\cos(t), \sin(t))$, from $\RR$ to $\S^1$, is smooth andsurjective. Also note that, the function $\cos$,restricted to the interval $\left]k\pi,\pi +  k\pi\right[$, where $k \in \ZZ$, is a diffeomorphism onto$\left]0,1\right[$. As well, the function $\sin$, restrictedto $\left]-\pi/2 + k\pi , \pi/2 + k\pi\right[$, is adiffeomorphism onto $\left]0,1\right[$. For $k=0$ theinverses are the standard functions $\acos$ and $\asin$.Let us denote, for now, the inverses ofthese restrictions by%%###########\begin{figure}[tb]  \centerline{\includegraphics{Figures-PDF/fig-SinCosII.pdf}}  \caption{The functions sine  and cosine.}\label{The-functions-sine-and-cosine}\end{figure}%%###########$$\acos_k : \left]0,1\right[ \to  \left]k,\pi + k\right[ \qmbox{and} \asin_k :  \left]0,1\right[ \to \left]-\pi/2 + k , \pi/2 + k\right[.  $$Now, let $\P : \U \to  \S^1$ be a smooth parametrization of $\S^1$, that is,$\P(r) = (x(r),y(r))$, where $x$ and $y$ are smooth realparametrizations and $x(r)^2 + y(r)^2 = 1$. Let $r_0 \in  \U$. We shall distinguish four cases:  \alinea{a)} $y(r_0) \in \left]0,+1\right[$.

Locally, $r \mapsto    \asin_1(y(r))$ is  a local lifting  of $\P$ along $\Pi$.\alinea{}Therefore, $\Pi : \RR \to \S^1$ is a subduction. In other words,$\Pi$ is strict \art{Strict-maps-between-quotients-and-subspaces},and its factorization identifies naturally the quotient $\RR/2\pi\ZZ$ with $\S^1 \subset \RR^2$.\endsolexref\solexref{Subduction-onto-diffeomorphisms}(Subduction onto diffeomorphisms)Let us begin first by noting that, for all $f,g \in \G$,$(g \circ f)'(x) \neq 0$, because $(g \circ f)'(x) = g'(f(x)) f'(x)$,$f'(x) \neq 0$ and $g'(x) \neq 0$.Note next that,since $f'(x)\neq 0$ for all $x \in \RR$, $f'(x)$ has a constant sign. Thus,if $f'(x) > 0$, then $f$ is strictly increasing and $f(x + 2\pi) = f(x) + 2\pi$, else if $f'(x) <0$, then $f$ is strictly decreasing and$f(x + 2\pi) = f(x) - 2\pi$. Note that generally, for all $k \in \ZZ$,$f(x + 2\pi k) = f(x) + 2\pi k$ if $f$ is increasing, and $f(x + 2\pi k) = f(x) - 2\pi k$ if $f$ is decreasing.%Now, it is immediate that, in any case: increasing or decreasing, for all $g,f \in \G$,$(g \circ f)(x + 2\pi) = (g \circ f)(x) \pm 2\pi$. Moreover, for all $f \in \G$, $f$ is unbounded. Therefore, $f \in \Diff(\RR)$, and $\G$ is a subgroup of $\Diff(\RR)$.  %Now, let us check that ($\diamondsuit$) defines a diffeology of $\Diff(\S^1)$. Let $r \mapsto f$ be a constant parametrization, for all plots $\Q$ of $\S^1$, $(r,s) \mapsto f(\Q(r)) = f \circ \Q(r)$ is a plot of $\S^1$ since $f$ and $\Q$are smooth. Axiom D1 is checked. Now, let $\P : \U \to \Diff(\S^1)$ be a parametrizationsuch that for all $r \in \U$ there exists an open neighborhood $\W$ of $r$ such that $\P \restriction \W$ satisfies ($\diamondsuit$). For all plots $\Q : \V \to \S^1$,$(r,s) \mapsto (\P \restriction \W)(r)(\Q(s))$, defined on $\W \times \V$, issmooth. Thus, the parametrization  $(r,s) \mapsto \P(r)(\Q(s))$ is locally smooth, therefore smooth. Axiom D2 is checked. Let $\P : \U \to \Diff(\S^1)$ satisfying ($\diamondsuit$), and $\F : \W \to \U$ be a smooth parametrization. Let $\Q : \V \to \S^1$ be a plot, then $(t,s) \mapsto (r= \F(t),s) \mapsto \P(r)(\Q(s)) = (\P \circ \F)(t)(\Q(s))$ is smooth since it is the composite of smooth maps. Axiom D3 is checked. Therefore,($\diamondsuit$) defines a diffeology of $\Diff(\S^1)$.%Let us assume $f' >0$. Note that $\Pi \circ f : \RR \to \S^1$ is smooth and surjective. Next,$(\Pi \circ f)(x+2\pi) = \Pi (f(x)+2\pi) = (\cos(f(x) + 2\pi), \sin(f(x) + 2\pi))= (\cos(f(x)),\sin(f(x))) = \Pi \circ f(x)$. Thus $\Pi \circ f(x)$ is $2\pi$-periodic, therefore there exists a function $\varphi : \S^1 \to \S^1$ defined by$\varphi(z) = \Pi \circ f(x)$ for every $x \in \RR$ such that $z = (\cos(x),\sin(x))$.\begin{center}\begin{tikzpicture}[ auto]  \node (B)  at (2,0) {$\RR$};  \node (C)  at (4,0) {$\RR$};  \node (D)  at (0,-2) {$\V$};  \node (E)  at (2,-2) {$\S^1$};  \node (F)  at (4,-2) {$\S^1$};  \draw[->] (B) to node {$f$} (C);  \draw[->] (B) to node  {$\Pi$} (E);  \draw[->] (D) to node  {$\Q$} (B);  \draw[->] (D) to node  [swap] {$\P \restriction \V$} (E);  \draw[->] (C) to node  {$\Pi$} (F);  \draw[->] (E) to node [swap] {$\varphi$} (F);\end{tikzpicture}\end{center}Let $\P : \U \to \S^1$ be a plot, since $\Pi$ is a subduction, \exref{Subduction-onto-the-circle}, for all $r \in \U$ there exist an open neighborhood $\V$ of $r$ and a smoothparametrization $\Q$ of $\RR$ such that $\Pi \circ \Q = (\P \restriction \V)$.Thus, $\varphi \circ (\P \restriction \V) = (\varphi \circ \Pi \circ \Q)\restriction \V = \Pi \circ f \circ \Q$, that is,a composite of smooth maps. Thus $\varphi \circ (\P \restriction \V)$ is a plot of $\S^1$, and therefore $\varphi \circ \P$.Now, thanks to $f(x+2\pi) = f(x) + 2\pi$, by denoting $y=f(x)$ and composing with$f^{-1}$, we get $f^{-1}(y+2\pi) = f^{-1}(y) + 2\pi$. Hence, there existsa surjective smooth map $\bar\varphi : \S^1 \to \S^1$ such that  $\Pi \circ f^{-1} = \bar\varphi \circ \Pi$. Composing the two identities we get$\varphi \circ \bar\varphi = \bar\varphi \circ \varphi = \id_{\S^1}$, thus $\bar\varphi = \varphi^{-1}$.Since $\varphi$ and $\bar\varphi$ are smooth, $\varphi$ is a diffeomorphism of $\S^1$.Next, let $\psi = \Phi(g)$, $\Pi \circ g = \psi \circ \Pi$. Thus,$\Pi \circ (g \circ f) = (\psi \circ \varphi) \circ \Pi$, therefore$\Phi(g \circ f) = \Phi(g) \circ \Phi(f)$, and $\Phi : \G \to \Diff(\S^1)$ isa homomorphism. Let $f \in \ker(\Phi)$, that is, $\Pi \circ f = \Pi$, thenfor all $x$, $f(x) = x + 2\pi k(x)$ with $k(x) \in \ZZ$,but $x \mapsto k(x) = f(x) -x$ is smooth, hence $k(x) = k$ is constant. The case $f'<0$ is analogous.Therefore, $\ker(\Phi) = \{ x \mapsto x + 2\pi k \mid k \in \ZZ \} \simeq \ZZ$. %Now, let us show that $\Phi$ is surjective. Let $\varphi \in \Diff(\S^1)$, $\varphi \circ \Pi$ is smooth and we admitted that there exists a smooth lift$f : \RR \to \RR$ such that $\Pi \circ f = \varphi \circ \Pi$ (it is actually a consequence of the monodromy theorem \art{Monodromy-theorem}).\alinea{a)} Necessarily $f(x + 2\pi) = f(x) + 2\pi k(x)$, andfor the same reason as just above, $k(x) = k$ is constant. Note that $k$ is necessarily nonzero, $f$ cannot be periodic since a periodic function has necessarily a point where$f'$ vanishes, and this is impossible since $f$ projects onto a diffeomorphism of the circle. Then, note that $(1/k)f(x + 2\pi) = (1/k)f(x) + 2\pi$. Thus, there exists a smooth function $\psi : \S^1 \to \S^1$ such that $\psi(z) = \Pi((1/k)f(x))$, $z = \Pi(x)$.Defining $\hat k(z) = \Pi(kx)$, we get $\phi(z) = \hat k \circ \psi(x)$. But $\psi$ and $\hat k$ are surjective and $\hat k$ is not injective if $k \neq \pm 1$, thus $k = \pm 1$and $f(x+2\pi) = f(x) \pm 2\pi$. Considering $\varphi^{-1}$, the same argument gives $g \in \Cinfty(\RR)$ such that $\varphi^{-1} \circ \Pi = \Pi \circ g$ and $g(x + 2\pi) = g(x) \pm 2\pi$. \alinea{b)} Now, $\Pi \circ (f \circ g) =\Pi \circ(g \circ f) = \Pi$, and hence $f \circ g$, as well as $g \circ f$, belongs to $\ker(\Phi)$, that is, $g \circ f(x) = x + 2\pi \ell$ and $f \circ g(x) = x + 2\pi \ell'$,  $\ell, \ell' \in \ZZ$. Then, since $(g\circ f)'(x) = g'(f(x))f'(x) = 1$, $f$ and $g$ are both strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.Next, left composition of $f \circ g(x) = x + 2\pi \ell'$ with $g$ gives $\ell' = \ell$ if $f$ and $g$ are increasing, and $\ell' = - \ell$ otherwise. In both cases, let $\bar f (x) = g(x) - 2\pi\ell$, then $\bar f$ still satisfies$\varphi^{-1} \circ \Pi = \Pi \circ \bar f$, but now $f \circ \bar f = \bar f \circ f = \id_\RR$. Therefore $\bar f = f^{-1}$,$f \in \G$ and $\Phi$ is surjective.\alinea{}Now, let us consider a plot $\P : r \mapsto \varphi_r$ of $\Diff(\S^1)$ defined on an open ball $\eB$. Thus, $(r,x) \mapsto \varphi_r(\Pi(x))$ is a smoothparametrization of $\S^1$, defined on $\eB \times \RR$. We admitted that there exists a smooth lift $(r,x) \mapsto f_r(x)$, from $\eB \times \RR$ to $\RR$ along $\Pi$, that is, $\Pi \circ f_r(x) = \varphi_r \circ \Pi(x)$. Applying a) to this situation, we get a smooth function $r \mapsto k_r$, defined on $\eB$ to $\ZZ$ such that $2\pi k_r = f_r(x+2\pi) - f_r(x)$. Thus,$k_r = k$ is constant. By continuing same reasoning, we get two plots$r \mapsto f_r$ and $r \mapsto g_r$ such that $f_r(x+2\pi) = f_r(x) \pm 2\pi$,$g_r(x + 2\pi) = g_r(x) \pm 2\pi$ and $\Pi \circ (f_r \circ g_r) =\Pi \circ(g_r \circ f_r) = \Pi$, where the sign $+$ or $-$ is constant on $\eB$.Then, we get similarly  $g_r \circ f_r(x) = x + 2\pi \ell_r$ and $f_r \circ g_r(x) = x + 2\pi \ell'_r$,  $\ell_r, \ell'_r \in \ZZ$. For the same reason as previously, $\ell_r = \ell$ and $\ell'_r = \ell'$ are constant, and $\ell' = \pm \ell$ according to the situation. Thus,the change $\bar f_r = g_r - 2\pi \ell$ still defines a plot, and $\bar f_r = f_r^{-1}$. Therefore,thanks to b) we deduce that $f_r \in \G$for all $r$, and satisfies: $\Pi \circ f_r = \varphi_r \circ \Pi$ and $\Pi \circ f_r^{-1} = \varphi_r \circ \Pi$. Thus we get a plot $r \mapsto f_r$covering $r \mapsto \varphi_r$, that is, $\Phi(f_r) = \varphi_r$, for all $r \in \eB$. Finally, considering a general plot $r \mapsto \varphi_r$, defined on some real domain, every point is the center of some open ball, and applying what we just checked, we can locally lift smoothly this plot in $\G$ along $\Phi$. Therefore, $\Phi$ is a subduction. Moreover, the kernel of $\Phi$ being $\ZZ$, as we have seen above, the fiber of the projection $\Phi$ are the orbits of the action of $\ZZ$ on $\G$, that is, $k(f) = f + 2\pi k$, $k \in \ZZ$ and$f \in \G$. \alinea{}For the fifth question, let us note that, since $(x,a) \mapsto x+a$ is clearly smooth, the map $a \mapsto \T_a = [x \mapsto x+a]$ is smooth. Conversely if $r \mapsto \T_{a(r)}$ is a plot of $\G$, then$a(r) = \T_{a(r)}(0)$ and thus $r \mapsto a(r)$ is smooth. Therefore $a \mapsto \T_a$ is an induction and the image of $\RR$ in $\G$ is diffeomorphic to $\RR$. Now, since $\Phi$ is a subduction, the map $\phi : \RR/2\pi\ZZ \to \Diff(\S^1)$, defined by $\phi(\class(a)) = \Phi(\T_a)$ is an induction. Since $\RR/2\pi\ZZ$ is diffeomorphic to $\S^1$, thanks to $\Pi$, the image of $\RR$ by $a \mapsto \Phi(\T_a)$, equipped with the subset diffeology,is diffeomorphic to the circle.\endsolexref%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% %% Quotients of diffeological spaces%% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\SkipTocEntry\section*{Quotients of Diffeological Spaces}\solexref{Quotients-of-discrete-or-coarse-spaces}(Quotients of discrete or coarse spaces)Let $\discrete{\X}$ be a discrete diffeological space: the plotsof $\X$ are locally constant parametrizations\art{Discrete-diffeology}.

Then, thanks to the uniqueness of quotients \art{Uniqueness-of-quotient}, to get the identification $\S^1 \simeq \RR/\ZZ$ we just have to check that the map $t \mapsto \exp(2\pi i t)$ is a subduction, but the subduction has been proved in \exref{Subduction-onto-the-circle}. Regarding the irrational torus $\Torus_\alpha$ in \exref{Diffeomorphisms-between-irrational-tori}, or the quotient $\RR/\QQ$ of \exref{Smooth-maps-on-R/Q}, the diffeology defined by (\blacksnow) is, by definition, the quotient diffeology. Concerning the diffeology of $\Diff(\S^1)$ defined in \exref{Subduction-onto-diffeomorphisms}, we haveseen that the map $\G \to \Diff(\S^1)$ is surjective, and set theoretically$\Diff(\S^1) \sim \G/\ZZ$, where $\ZZ \sim \ker(\Phi)$. Since $\Phi$ is a subduction,by uniqueness of quotients we get that diffeologically $\Diff(\S^1) \simeq \G/\ZZ$.\endsolexref\solexref{The-irrational-solenoid}(The irrational solenoid)1) let us check that the map $q : (x,y) \mapsto (p(x), p(y))$, where$p(t) = (\cos(2\pi t),\sin(2\pi t))$, is strict. First of all, this map isclearly smooth since $\cos$ and $\sin$ are smooth. Now, according to the definition, $q$ is strict if and only if the map $$\class(x,y) \mapsto \left((\cos(2\pi x),\sin(2\pi x)),(\cos(2\pi y),\sin(2\pi y))\right)$$is an induction, from $\RR^2/\ZZ^2$ to $\RR^2 \times \RR^2$, where $\class : \RR^2 \to \RR^2/\ZZ^2$ denotes the natural projection.We know already that $\Pi : t \mapsto (\cos(2\pi t),\sin(2\pi t))$ is strict,\exref{Subduction-onto-the-circle}, and $q$ is just the product $\Pi \times \Pi$.Thus, a plot $\Phi : \U \to \S^1 \times \S^1 \subset \RR^2 \times \RR^2$ is just apair of plots $\P$ and $\Q$ from $\U$ to $\S^1$, which can be individually smoothly lifted locally along $\Pi$, and give a local lift of $q$ itself. Therefore, $q$ is strict. Now, since $\alpha$ is irrational, $q_\alpha = q \restriction \Delta_\alpha$ is injective. Indeed, for $t,t' \in \RR$, $q(t,\alpha t) = q(t',\alpha t')$ means $(\cos(2\pi t'),\sin(2\pi t')) = (\cos(2\pi t),\sin(2\pi t))$ and$(\cos(2\pi \alpha t'),\sin(2\pi \alpha t')) = (\cos(2\pi \alpha t),\sin(2\pi \alpha t))$,that is, $t' = t + k$ and $\alpha t' = \alpha t + k'$ with $k,k' \in \ZZ$, that gives $\alpha k - k' = 0$, thus $k=k' = 0$ and $t'=t$.\alinea{2)} Let $\Phi : \U \to \cS_\alpha \subset \S^1 \times \S^1 \subset \RR^2 \times \RR^2$ be a plot, with $\Phi(r)=(\P(r),\Q(r))$. Since $q$ is strict, for all $r \in \U$, there exists locally a smooth lift $r' \mapsto (x(r'),y(r'))$ in $\RR^2$, defined on a neighborhood $\V$ of $r$, such that $q(x(r'),y(r')) = (\P(r'),\Q(r'))$Thus, $q(x(r'),y(r')) \in \cS_\alpha$for all $r' \in \V$. But, $r' \mapsto (x(r'),\alpha x(r')) \in \Delta_\alpha \subset \RR^2$ is smooth,and $q(x(r'),\alpha x(r'))$ belongs to $\cS_\alpha$ too. Therefore, there exists $r' \mapsto k(r') \in \ZZ$ such that$y(r') = \alpha x(r') + k(r')$, that is,$k(r') = y(r') - x(r')$. Thus, $r' \mapsto k(r')$ is smooth and takes its values in $\ZZ$, hence$k(r') = k$ constant. Then, $r' \mapsto (x(r'), y(r') - k)$ is a plot of $\cS_\alpha$ with $q(x(r'), y(r') - k) = (\P(r'),\Q(r'))$, thus $q_\alpha : \Delta_\alpha \to \cS_\alpha$ is an injective subduction,that is, a diffeomorphism from $\Delta_\alpha$to $\cS_\alpha$, and therefore an induction.\alinea{3)} We use the identification given by the factorization $h : \RR^2/\ZZ^2 \to \S^1 \times \S^1$, of the strict map $q: \RR^2 \to \S^1 \times \S^1$. Then, the quotient $(\S^1 \times \S^1)/\cS_\alpha = h(\RR^2/\ZZ^2)/\cS_\alpha$, is equivalent to $\RR^2/[\ZZ^2(\Delta_\alpha)]$ where the equivalence relation is defined by the action of the subgroup $\ZZ^2(\Delta_\alpha)$, that is, theset of $(x + n, \alpha x + m)$ with $x \in \RR$ and $(n,m) \in \ZZ^2$.Let $\rho : \RR^2 \to \RR^2$ be defined by $\rho(x,y) = (0, y -\alpha x)$, it is obviously a projector, $\rho \circ \rho = \rho$,and clearly $\class \circ \rho = \class$, with $\class : \RR^2 \to \RR^2/[\ZZ^2(\Delta_\alpha)]$.Now, let $\X' = \Val(\rho)$, that is, $\X' = \{0\} \times \RR$.The restriction to $\X'$ of the equivalencerelation, defined by the action of $\ZZ^2(\Delta_\alpha)$ on $\RR^2$, is defined by the action of $\ZZ^2$, $(n,m) : (0,y) \mapsto (0, y +m -\alpha n)$. Therefore, the quotient$(\S^1 \times \S^1)/\cS_\alpha$ is equivalent to $\X'/(\ZZ + \alpha \ZZ)$ \xart{Section-of-a-quotient}{note}, that is, equivalent to $\RR/(\ZZ + \alpha \ZZ) = \Torus_\alpha$. \endsolexref\solexref{A-minimal-powerset-diffeology}(A minimal powerset diffeology)Let $\Powerset(\X)^*$ be the set of all the non empty subsets of $\X$,thus $\Powerset(\X) = \{\varnothing\} \cup \Powerset(\X)^*$.Let $\cD$ be the set of parametrizations of $\Powerset(\X)^*$ defined as follows.\begin{itemize}\item[($\heartsuit$)] A parametrization $\P : \U \to \Powerset(\X)^*$ belongs to $\cD$ if, for all $r \in \U$, there exist an open neighborhood$\V \subset \U$ of $r$ and a plot $\Q : \V \to \X$ such that, for all $r' \in \V$, $\Q(r') \in \P(r')$. \end{itemize}Let us check that $\cD$ is a diffeology. Let $\P : r \mapsto \A \in \Powerset(\X)^*$ be a constant parametrization,let $x \in \A$. The constant parametrization $\Q : r \mapsto x$ satisfies$\Q(r) \in \P(r)$. The covering axiom is thus satisfied. The locality axiom is satisfied by construction. Now, let $\P : \U \to \Powerset^*(\X)$ belonging to $\cD$, and $\F : \U' \to \U$ be a smoothparametrization. Let $r' \in \U'$ and $r = \F(r')$, let $\V \subset \U$ be a neighborhood of $r$ and $\Q : \V \to \X$ be a plot such that $\Q(s) \in \P(s)$ for all $s \in \V$, according to ($\heartsuit$).Let $\V' = \F^{-1}(\V)$, since $\F$ issmooth, thus continuous, $\V'$ is an open neighborhood of $r'$. Now, $\Q' = \Q \circ \F$ is a plot of $\X$, and satisfies $\Q'(s) = (\Q \circ \F)(s) \in (\P \circ \F)(s)$ for all $s \in \V'$.Thus, the smooth compatibility axiom is satisfied and $\cD$ is a diffeology of$\Powerset(\X)^*$. Next, we consider  $\Powerset(\X)$ as the diffeological sumof the singleton $\{\varnothing\}$ and the diffeological space $\Powerset(\X)^*$,equipped with $\cD$. Then, let us consider an equivalence relation $\sim$ on $\X$. The subset $\quotient{\X}{\sim} = \class(\X)$ is contained in $\Powerset(\X)^*$,since no class is empty. Let $\P : \U \to \quotient{\X}{\sim}$ be a plot of$\Powerset(\X)^*$. For each $r \in \U$, let us choose $x_r \in \X$such that $\class(x_r) = \P(r)$, that is, $x_r \in \P(r)$. By definition of $\cD$,there exists --- defined on a neighborhood of each point of $\U$ ---a plot $\Q$ of $\X$ such that $\Q(r) \in \P(r)$, that is, $\Q(r) \in \class(x_r)$.Thus, $\class(\Q(r)) = \class(x_r) = \P(r)$, hence, $\Q$ is a local smooth lift of $\P$ along $\class$, and that is the definition of the quotient diffeology on $\quotient{\X}{\sim}$. \endsolexref\solexref{Universal-construction}(Universal construction)First of all, let us note that $\ev : \cN \to \X$ is surjective. Then, every plot $\P : \U \to \X$ lifts naturally by $\PP : r \mapsto (\P,r)$ in $\cN$, along $\ev$: $\ev \circ \PP = \P$. Therefore $\ev : \cN \to \X$ is a subduction and $\X$ is the diffeological quotient of $\cN$ by the relation$(\P,r) \sim (\P',r')$ if and only if $\P(r) = \P'(r')$. Next, let us assume that the map $\sigma : x \mapsto ([0 \mapsto x],0) \in \cN$ is smooth. Thus, for every plot $\P : \U \to \X$, $\sigma \circ \P : r \mapsto ([0 \mapsto \P(r)],0)$ is a plot of $\cN$. By definition of the diffeological sum\art{Building-sums-with-spaces}, for all $r \in \U$, there exists an open neighborhood $\V$ of $r$ such that  $[0 \mapsto \P(r)]$is constant on $\V$, that is, $\P(r) = x$ for some $x \in \X$ and for all $r \in \V$, butthis is the definition of the discrete diffeology \art{Discrete-diffeology}. Therefore, if the set of 0-plots is a smooth section of $\ev : \cN \to \X$, then$\X$ is discrete, and conversely. \endsolexref\solexref{Strict-action-of-SO(3)-on-R3}(Strict action of $\SO(3)$ on $\RR^3$)If $\X = 0 \in \RR^3$ then obviously $\orb{0} : \SO(3) \mapsto 0$ is a trivial subduction. Let us assume that $\X \neq 0$, the orbit $\SO(3)\cdot \X$is the sphere of vectors $\X'$ with norm $\rho =\norm{\X}$. By construction,$\SO(3)$ preserves the norm. Now, let $r \mapsto \X_r$ be a plotof $\RR^3$ such that $\norm{\X_r} = \rho$. Let $u_r = \X_r/\rho$, thus $r \mapsto u_r$ is a plot of the unit sphere $\S^2 \subset \RR^3$, for the subset diffeology. Let $r_0$ be a point in the domain of this plot, there exists a vector $w$ not collinear with $u_{r_0}$.The parametrization $r \mapsto w_r = \left[\id_{\RR^3} - u_r u_r^t\right]w$ is smooth, where $u_r^t$ is the transpose of the vector $u_r$, and $\left[\id_{\RR^3} - u_r u_r^t\right]$ is the projector orthogonal to $u_r$.The real function $\nu : r \mapsto \norm{w_r}$ is smooth,and since $w$ is not collinear with $u_{r_0}$, $\nu(r_0) \neq 0$. Thus, thereexists a (possibly small) open ball $\eB$, centered at $r_0$, such that for all$r \in \eB$, $\nu(r) \neq 0$. Therefore, the parametrization$r \mapsto v_r = w_r/\nu(r)$, defined on $\eB$, is a plot of the sphere $\S^2$satisfying $v_r \perp u_r$. Next, let $\N_r = \left[u_r \ v_r \ u_r \wedge v_r \right]$ be the matrix madeby juxtaposing the three column vectors, the symbol $\wedge$ denoting the vector product. By construction, $r \mapsto \N_r$ is smooth and $\N_r \in \SO(3)$.Now, $\N_r \ee_1 = u_r$, where $\ee_1$ is the first vector of the canonical basisof $\RR^3$. By the same way, we can find a unit vector $v$, orthogonal to $u = \X/\rho$, such that$\M = \left[u \ v \ u \wedge v \right] \in \SO(3)$, and thus $\M \ee_1 = u$.Hence, the parametrization $r \mapsto \M_r = \N_r\M^t$ is smooth, takes its values in $\SO(3)$ and satisfies $\M_r \X = \X_r$. Therefore, the orbit map $\orb{\X}$ is strict.\Note That is a particular case of a more general theorem:for a Lie group acting smoothly on a manifold, Hausdorff and second countable, the orbit map is always strict \cite{IZK10}.\endsolexref%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% %% Products of diffeological spaces %% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\SkipTocEntry\section*{Products of Diffeological Spaces}\solexref{Products-and-discrete-diffeology} (Products and discrete diffeology)Let us equip the product $\X = \prod_{i \in \cI} \X_i$ with the discrete diffeology.Thus, every plot $r \mapsto x$ of $\X$ is locally constant, and thenany composite $r \mapsto x_i$ is locally constant too, thus smooth (first axiom of diffeology).This is an example, related to the discussion \art{playing-with-bounds}, where the interesting setof diffeologies on $\X$ ---~the ones such that the projections $\pi_i$ are smooth~---is trivialy bounded below. The supremum of this family, which is a maximum (the product diffeology), is thereforethe distinguished diffeology. However, it is not the only reason for which that diffeology isinteresting, see \art{Projections-on-factors-are-subductions}.%If we consider the sum diffeology of the family \art{Building-sums-with-spaces},that is, $\X' = \coprod_{i \in \cI} \X_i$, and if we equip $\X'$ with the coarse diffeology, then the canonical injections $j_i : \X_i \to \X'$, defined by $j_i(x) = (i,x)$, are smooth, simply because any map to a coarse space issmooth. In that case, the set of diffeologies such that the injections are smoothis bounded above by the coarse diffeology, the distinguished diffeology is thusthe infimum of that family, that is, the sum diffeology. It is not surprising, products and coproducts are dual constructions one from each other. \endsolexref\solexref{Product-of-coarse-or-discrete-spaces} (Products of coarse or discrete spaces)Let us consider the product $\X = \prod_{i \in \cI}\X_i$of coarse spaces. Let $\P$ be any parametrization of$\X$. Since for every projection $\pi_i$, thecomposition $\pi_i \circ \P$ is a parametrization of$\X_i$, the parametrization $\P$ isa plot of the product. Therefore, the product diffeologyis coarse.%Now, let $\X = \prod_{i \in  \cI} \X_i$ be a finite product of discrete spaces, let$\N = \#\cI$. Let $\P : \U \to \X$ be a plot. For every$i \in \cI$, $\pi_i \circ \P$ is locally constant. Let$r_0 \in \U$, so there exist $\N$ open neighborhoods $\V_i$of $r_0$ and $\N$ points $x_i$, such that $x_i \in \X_i$and $\pi_i \circ \P \restriction \V_i = [r \mapsto x_i]$.Hence, since $\#\cI$ is finite, $\V = \cap_{i \in \cI}  \V_i$, $\V$ is still an open neighborhood of $r_0$, and  $\P    \restriction \V$ is constant, equal to $s = [i \mapsto     (i,x_i)]$. Therefore, $\P$ is locally constant and $\X$ isdiscrete.%Next, let us consider an arbitrary product $\X = \prod_{i \in  \cI} \X_i$ of discrete spaces. We cannot apply theprevious method, since an arbitrary intersection ofdomains may be not open. Then, we shall use the resultof \exref{Locally-constant-parametrizations}. Let $\P :  \U \to \X$ be a plot. By definition of the productdiffeology, for all $i \in \cI$, $\pi_i \circ \P$ is aplot of $\X_i$, that is, locally constant. Now, let $r_0$be any point of $\U$, thanks to\exref{Locally-constant-parametrizations}, $\pi_i \circ  \P$ is constant on the path connected component $\V$ of$r_0$. Thus, for every $i \in \cI$, $\pi_i \circ \P  \restriction \V = [r \mapsto x_i]$, where $x_i = \pi_i    \circ \P(r_0)$. Hence, $\P \restriction \V = [i      \mapsto (i,x_i)]$ is a constant parametrization.Therefore, $\P$ is locally constant and $\X$ is discrete.\endsolexref\solexref{Infinite-product-of-R-over-R}(Infinite product of $\RR$ over $\RR$)The sum $\X = \coprod_{t\in \RR} \RR$ is the set of pairs$(t,s)$, with $t$ and $s$ in $\RR$.

Therefore $f$ issmooth. %Conversely, let $f : \X \to \X'$ be asmooth map and $\P : \U \to \X$ be a plot. Then,$f \circ \P$ is a plot of $\X'$, and $\Q : r \mapsto (\P(r), f \circ \P(r))$ is a plot of $\X \times \X'$.But $\Val(\Q) \subset \graph(f)$, so $\Q$ is a plot of$\graph(f)$, for the subset diffeology.

The image of $f$ is an(affine) line of $\RR^n$ if and only if $v \neq 0$. The coefficients$x$ and $v$ are called the {\em origin} for $x$, since $x = f(0)$, andthe {\em velocity} for $v$, since $v = f'(0)$. Hence, defining thissubspace $\PL(\RR^n)$ of polynomials as the space of {\em parametrizedlines} of $\RR^n$ makes sense. \alinea{1)} Let $f = [t \mapsto x + t v] $ and $g = [t \mapsto x' + tv']$ be twolines having the same image in $\RR^n$, that is, $f(\RR) = g(\RR)$.So, $x' = g'(0) \in f(\RR)$, thus there exists a number $b$ such that$x' = x + bv$. Now, since $f(\RR) = g(\RR)$ the derivative of $f$ and$g$ are proportional. Thus, there exists a number $a$ such that $v' = av$.But since $v$ and $v'$ are not zero, $a \neq 0$. Hence, $g(t) = x +  bv + atv = x + (at + b) v$, and then $g(t) = f(at + b)$. Conversely if$g(t) = f(at + b)$, since $a \neq 0$, it is clear that $g(\RR) =  f(\RR)$.\alinea{2)} The set $(a,b) : t \mapsto at + b$ of transformations  of $\RR$,where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers such that $a \neq 0$, is theaffine group, denoted by $\Aff(\RR)$.

It is in fact an anti-action, since$(a,b)[(a',b')(f)] = f \circ (a',b') \circ (a,b) =  [(a',b') \circ (a,b)](f)$. \alinea{3)} Thanks to the\exref{The-space-of-polynomials} we know that the inclusion $(x,v)  \mapsto [t \mapsto x + tv]$ is an induction from $(\RR^n)^2$ to$\Cinfty(\RR,\RR^n)$. Hence $\PL(\RR^n)$, equipped with the functionaldiffeology, is diffeomorphic to $\RR^n \times (\RR^n - \{0\})$.\alinea{4)} Thus, the equivalence relation defining the oriented trajectory of theparam\-etri\-zed line is the following, $(x,v)\sim (x+bv,av)$ where $(a,b)  \in \Aff_+(\RR)$, that is, $a, b \in \RR$ and $a \neq 0$. Now, the map$\rho$ consists into two maps. The second one $v \mapsto u$ is welldefined and smooth since $v \neq 0$. The first one is the orthogonalprojector to $u$ or, which is equivalent, to $v$. In other words $r =  [\id_n - u \bar u] x$, where $\bar u$ is the covector $\bar u : w    \mapsto u \cdot w$. Therefore, $\rho$ is a smooth map from $\RR^n \times      (\RR^n - \{0\})$ into itself. Finally, the image of $\rho$ is clearlythe subset of $\RR^n \times \RR^n$ made up with the pairs ofvectors $(r,u)$ such that $u \cdot r = 0$ and  $\norm{u} = 1$, which isequivalent to $\T\S^{n-1}$, as it has been defined.%Now, let $f$ and $g$ be the lines defined respectively by $(x,v)$ and $(x',v')$. Let usassume that $\rho(x,v) = \rho(x',v') = (r,u)$. So, $u = v/\norm{v} =  v'/\norm{v'}$. Thus, there exists $a > 0$ such that $v' = av$. Then,$[\id_n - u \bar u] x = [\id_n - u \bar u] x' = r$ implies that theorthogonal projection to  $u$ of $x' - x$  is zero, hence $x'-x$ isproportional to $u$, or which is equivalent, to $v$. Thus, there existsa number $b$ such that $x' = x + bv$. Therefore, if $\rho(x',v') =  \rho(x,v)$, then there exists an element $(a,b) \in \Aff_+(\RR)$ suchthat $g = (a,b)(f)$, and the lines defined by $(x',v')$ and $(x,v)$ havethe same oriented trajectory. The converse is as clear as the directway. Moreover, if $v$ is unitary and $x$ is orthogonal to $v$, then$\rho(x,v) = (v,x)$. Hence  $\rho \circ \rho = \rho$. Therefore, the map $\rho$satisfies the conditions of proposition \art{Section-of-a-quotient}. Itsimage, equivalent to $\T\S^{n-1}$, is diffeomorphic to the quotientspace $[\RR^n \times (\RR^n - \{0\})]/\Aff_+(\RR)$, that is, diffeomorphicto $\UL_+(\RR^n) = \PL(\RR^n)/\Aff_+(\RR)$. %Considering the lines in $\RR^2$, the space $\T\S^1$ describes the oriented unparametrized lines, a point $(x,u) \in \T\S^1$ describes the line passing through$x$ and directed by $u$. Hence, the set of unparametrized and non oriented lines is equivalent to the quotient $\T\S^1/\{\pm 1\}$, where $\varepsilon (x,u) = (x,\varepsilon u)$,$\varepsilon \in \{\pm 1 \}$. Thanks to the diffeomorphism $(x,u) \mapsto (u, r = x \cdot \J u)$ from $\T\S^1$ to $\S^1 \times \RR$, where $\J$ is the $\pi/2$ positive rotation, the action of $\{\pm 1\}$ transmutes into $\varepsilon(u,r) = (\varepsilon u, \varepsilon r)$. The quotient is a realization of the M\"obius strip.\endsolexref\solexref{A-diffeology-for-the-space-of-circles}(A diffeology for the set of circles) %%########### \begin{figure}[tb] \centerline{\includegraphics{Figures-PDF/fig-circle-ODE.pdf}} \caption{Initial conditions of the ODE.} \label{Circle-ODE} \end{figure} %%###########We shall describe the set of circles in the plane $\RR^2$ as the trajectories of the solutions of an ordinary differential equation.

But since$\RR$ is a real domain, $\pi$ is a plot of thequotient, and $\cF = \set{\pi}$ is a generating familyfor $\RR/\Gamma$, thus $\dim(\cF) = 1$. Hence, as a directconsequence of the definition\art{Dimension-of-a-diffeological-space} ---~or as a consequence of\art{Dimensions-of-quotients}, since $\dim(\RR) = 1$~---$\dim(\RR/\Gamma) \leq 1$. Now, if $\dim(\RR/\Gamma) =0$, then the diffeology of the quotient is generated bythe constant parametrizations. Since the projection$\pi$ is a plot, it lifts locally at the point $0$ inthe constant plot ${\bf 0} : \RR \to \set{0}$, but since$\RR$ is pathwise connected, the lift is global, see\exref{Locally-constant-parametrizations}, and $\pi =  {\bf [0]} \circ {\bf 0}$, where ${\bf [0]} : \set{0} \to    \RR/\Gamma$ maps $0$ to $[0] = \pi(0)$. Thus, since$\pi$ is surjective, $\RR/\Gamma = \set{[0]}$ and$\Gamma = \RR$. Therefore, if $\Gamma \subset \RR$ is astrict subgroup, that is, $\Gamma \neq \RR$, we havenecessarily $\dim(\RR/\Gamma) = 1$. In particular,this apply to the circle $\S^1 \simeq \RR/\ZZ$, see\exref{Subduction-onto-the-circle}, or to the irrational tori$\RR/\sum_{i = 1 \ldots \N} \alpha_i \ZZ$, where the $\alpha_i$ aresome numbers, independent over $\QQ$, see \exref{Generating-tori}. It also applies to $\RR/\QQ$, see\exref{Smooth-maps-on-R/Q}.

Since, by the very definition  of$\OG(n, \RR)$, $\norm{x'} = \norm{x}$ if and only if $x'= \A x$, with$\A \in \OG(n, \RR)$, there exists a bijection$f : \Delta_n \to \left[0, \infty \right[$ such that $f \circ \pi_n =  \nu_n$, where $\nu_n(x) = \norm{x}^2$.Now, thanks to the uniqueness of quotients \art{Uniqueness-of-quotient}, $f$ is a diffeomorphism between$\Delta_n$ equipped with the quotient diffeology and $\left[0, \infty  \right[$, equipped with the pushforward of the standard diffeology of$\RR^n$ by the map $\nu_n$. Now, let us denote by $\cD_n$ thepushforward of the standard diffeology of $\RR^n$ by $\nu_n$. The space$(\left[0, \infty \right[, \cD_n)$ is a representation of$\Delta_n$.\begin{center}\begin{tikzpicture}[auto]  \node (A)  at (0,0) {$\RR^n$};  \node (C)  at (0,-2) {$\Delta_n$};  \node (D)  at (2.5,-2) {$[0,\infty[$};  \draw[->] (A) to node [swap] {$\pi_n$} (C);  \draw[->] (C) to node [swap] {$f$} (D);  \draw[->] (A) to node  {$\nu_n$} (D);\end{tikzpicture}\end{center}\alinea{2)} Let us denote by $0_k$ the zero of $\RR^k$. Next, let us assume thatthe plot $\nu_n$ can be lifted at the point $0_n$ along a $p$-plot $\P : \U \to \Delta_n$, with $p < n$. Let $\phi : \V \to \U$ be a smoothparametrization  such that $\P \circ \phi = \nu_n  \restriction \V$. We can assume without loss of generality that$\P(0_p) = 0$ and $\phi(0_n) = 0_p$. If it is not the case we compose$\P$ with a translation mapping $\phi(0_n)$ to $0_p$. Now, since $\P$is a plot of $\Delta_n$, it can be lifted locally at the point $0_p$along $\nu_n$. Let $\psi : \W \to \RR^n$ be a smooth parametrization  such that $0_p \in \W$ and $\nu_n \circ \psi = \P    \restriction \W$. Let us introduce $\V' = \phi^{-1}(\W)$, we have then thefollowing commutative diagram.    \begin{center}  \begin{tikzpicture}  \node (A)  at (3,0) {$\W$};  \node (B)  at (0,-3) {$V'$};  \node (C)  at (3,-3) {$[0,\infty[$};  \node (D)  at (6,-3) {$\RR^n$};  \draw[->] (B) to node [auto] {$\phi \restriction \V'$} (A);  \draw[->] (B) to node [auto,swap] {$\nu_n \restriction \V'$} (C);  \draw[->] (A) to node [fill=white] {$\P \restriction \W$} (C);  \draw[->] (A) to node [auto] {$\psi$} (D);  \draw[->] (D) to node [auto] {$\nu_n$} (C);  \end{tikzpicture}    \end{center}Now, denoting by $\F = \psi \circ \phi  \restriction \V'$, we get $\nu_n \restriction \V' = \nu_n \circ \F$,with $\F \in \Cinfty(\V', \RR^n)$, $0_n \in \V'$ and $\F(0_n) = 0_n$,that is,$$  \norm{x}^2 = \norm{\F(x)}^2.  $$The derivative of this identity gives $$  x \cdot \delta x =  \F(x) \cdot \D(\F)(x)(\delta x),  \mbox{ for all } x \in \V' \mbox{ and for all } \delta x \in \RR^n.  $$The second derivative, computed at the point $0_n$, where $\F$vanishes, gives then$$  \id_n = \M^t \M \qmbox{with} \M = \D(\F)(0_n),  $$where $\M^t$ is the transposed matrix of $\M$. But $\D(\F)(0_n)  = \D(\psi)(0_p) \circ \D(\phi)(0_n)$. Let us denote $\A =    \D(\psi)(0_p)$  and $\B = \D(\phi)(0_n)$, $\A \in \Lin(\RR^p, \RR^n)$and $\B \in \Lin(\RR^n, \RR^p)$. Thus $\M = \A \B$ and the previousidentity $\id_n = \M^t \M$ becomes $\id_n = \B^t \A^t \A \B$. But the rank of $\B$ is less or equal to $p$ whichis, by hypothesis, strictly less than $n$, which would imply that therank of $\id_n$ is strictly less than $n$. And this is not true: the rank of $\id_n$ is $n$. Therefore, the plot $\nu_n$cannot be lifted locally at the point $0_n$ by a $p$-plot of $\Delta_n$with $p < n$.\alinea{3)} The diffeology of $\Delta_n$, represented by $(\left[0, \infty  \right[, \cD_n)$, is generated by $\nu_n$. Hence, $\cF = \set{\nu_n}$ isa generating family for $\Delta_n$. Therefore, by definition of thedimension of diffeological spaces\art{Dimension-of-a-diffeological-space}, $\dim(\Delta_n) \leq n$. Let us assume that$\dim(\Delta_n) = p$ with $p < n$. Then, since $\nu_n$ isa plot of $\Delta_n$ it can be lifted locally, at thepoint $0_n$, along an element $\P'$ of some generatingfamily $\cF'$ for $\Delta_n$. The family $\cF'$satisfies $\dim(\cF') = p$. But, by definition of thedimension of generating families\art{Dimension-of-a-family-of-parametrizations}, we get$\dim(\P') \leq p$, that is, $\dim(\P') < n$. This isnot possible, thanks to second question. Therefore,$\dim(\Delta_n) = n$. Now, since the dimension is adiffeological invariant\art{The-dimension-is-a-diffeological-invariant},$\Delta_n = \RR^n / \OG(n, \RR)$ is not diffeomorphic to$\Delta_m = \RR^m / \OG(m, \RR)$ when $n \neq m$.\endsolexref\solexref{Dimension-of-the-half-line}(Dimension of the half-line)First of all, let us remark that all the maps $\nu_n : \RR^n \to \Delta_\infty$, defined by $\nu_n(x) = \norm{x}^2$, are plots of$\Delta_\infty$. Indeed, these $\nu_n$ are smooth parametrizations of $\RR$ andtake their values in $\left[0, \infty \right[$. Now, let us assume that$\dim(\Delta_\infty) = \N < \infty$. Hence for any integer $n$, the plot$\nu_n$ lifts locally at the point $0_n$ along some $p$-plot of$\Delta_\infty$, with $p \leq \N$. Let us choose now$n > \N$. Then, there exist a smooth parametrization $f : \U \to \RR$such that $\Val(f) \subset \left[0, \infty \right[$,that is, $f$ is a $p$-plot of $\Delta_\infty$, and a smoothparametrization $\phi : \V \to \U$ such that $f \circ \phi = \nu_n \restriction \V$.  \begin{center}\begin{tikzpicture}[auto]  \node (B)  at (3,0) {$\U$};  \node (C)  at (0,-2) {$\V$};  \node (D)  at (3,-2) {$[0,\infty[$};  \draw[->] (C) to node {$\phi$} (B);  \draw[->] (C) to node [swap] {$\nu_n \restriction \V$} (D);  \draw[->] (B) to node {$f$} (D);\end{tikzpicture}\end{center}We can assume, without loss ofgenerality, that $0_p \in \U$, $\phi(0_n) = 0_p$, which implies$f(0_p) = 0$. Now, let us follow the method of\exref{Dimension-of-Rn/On}. The first derivative of $\nu_n$ at a point$x \in \V' = \phi^{-1}(\V)$ is given by: $$ x =  \D(f)(\phi(x)) \circ  \D(\phi)(x).  $$Since $f$ is smooth, positive, and $f(0)=0$, we have in particular$\D(f)(0_p) = 0$. Now, considering this property, the secondderivative, computed at the point $0_n$, gives in matricial notation:$$ \id_n = \M^t \H \M, \mbox{ where } \M = \D(\phi)(0) \mbox{ and } \H = \D^2(f)(0), $$ where $\M^t$ is $\M$ transposed, and $\H$ is the Hessian of $\phi$ at the point $0_n$, a symmetric bilinear map. The matrix $\M$represents the tangent map of $f$ at $0_p$. Now, since we chose $n > \N$ and assumed $p \leq \N$, we have $p < n$. Thus the map $\M$ hasa non zero kernel and then $\M^t \H \M$ is degenerate, which isimpossible since $\id_n$ is nondegenerate. Therefore, the dimension of $\Delta_\infty$ is unbounded, that is, infinite.\endsolexref%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% %% Local differentiablity%% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\SkipTocEntry\section*{Locality and Diffeologies}\solexref{To-be-a-locally-constant-map}(To be a locally constant map)Let $\gamma \in \Cinfty(\RR,\X)$ with $\gamma(0)= x_0$ and $\gamma(1)= x_1$.For all $t \in [0,1]$ there exists a superset $\V_t$ of $\gamma(t)$ such that$f \restriction \V_t$ is a local smooth map, according to the definition \art{Local-smooth-maps}.

If all thecomponents $\Pij$ of the parametrization $\P$ are smooth, then $(r,x)  \mapsto \sum_{i=1}^n x^i \Pij(r)  \ee_j$ is smooth, and the map $(r,x) \mapsto \P(r)(x)$ is smooth. Sincethe determinant of $\P(r)$ never vanishes, the same holds for $(r,x)  \mapsto \P(r)^{-1}(x)$. Therefore,$\P$ is a plot of the functional diffeology. %Conversely, if $\P$ is a plot of the functional diffeology --- that is,the parametrization$(r,x)\mapsto \P(r)(x)$ is smooth --- then, restricting thismap to $x = \ee_i$, we get that the map $r \mapsto \P(r)(\ee_i) =  \sum_{j=1}^n  \Pij(r)  \ee_i$ is smooth. So, by contracting this parametrization to thevector $\ee_j$, we get that all the matrix components $\Pij$ are smooth.Thus, the inclusion$\GL(n,\RR) \hookrightarrow \Diff(\RR^n)$ is an induction.\alinea{2)} The inclusion $\GL(n,\RR) \hookrightarrow \Diff(\RR^n)$ is anembedding.\alinea{}We have to show that the topology of$\GL(n,\RR)$ induced by the D-topology of $\Diff(\RR^n)$coincides with the D-topology of $\GL(n,\RR)$, that is, the topologyinduced by its inclusion into $\RR^{n \times n}$. %Let $\B({\bf 1}_{n},  \varepsilon)$ be the open ball in $\GL(n,\RR)$ centered at the identity${\bf 1}_{n}$, with radius $\varepsilon$. Let $\Omega_{\varepsilon}$ bethe set of all diffeomorphisms defined by%\begin{displaymath}  \Omega_{\varepsilon} = \{f\in \Diff(\RR^{n}) \mid \D (f)(0)\in \B({\bf  1}_{n}, \varepsilon) \},\end{displaymath}%where $\D(f)(0)$ is the tangent linear map of$f$ at the point $0$. Now, let us prove the following.\alinea{a)} The set $\Omega_{\varepsilon}$ is openfor the D-topology of $\Diff(\RR^{n})$.\alinea{}Let $\P : \U \rightarrow \Diff(\RR^{n})$ be a plot, that is,$[(r,x)\mapsto \P(r)(x)]\in  \Cinfty(\U \times \RR^{n},\RR^{n})$. The pullback of$\Omega_{\varepsilon}$ by$\P$ is the set of $r \in \U$ such that the tangent map$\D(\P(r))(0)$ is in the ball $\B({\bf 1}_{n}, \varepsilon)$, formally,$$  \P^{-1}(\Omega_{\varepsilon}) = \{ r\in \U \mid \D(\P(r))(0)  \in \B({\bf 1}_{n},  \varepsilon) \}.  $$Considering $\P$ as a smooth mapdefined on$\U \times  \RR^{n}$,$\D(\P(r))(0)$ is the partial derivative of $\P$, with respect tothe second variable, computed at the point $x=0$. The map $[r \mapsto \D(\P(r))(0)]$ is then continuous, bydefinition of smoothness. Hence, the pullback of$\Omega_{\varepsilon}$ by this map is open. Becausethe imprint of this open set on $\GL(n,\RR)$ is exactly the ball$\B({\bf 1}_{n}, \varepsilon)$, we deduce that any open ball of $\GL(n,\RR)$ centered at ${\bf 1}_{n}$ is the imprint of aD-open set of $\Diff(\RR^{n})$. \alinea{b)} Every open of $\GL(n,\RR)$ is the imprint of a D-open set of$\Diff(\RR^n)$.\alinea{}By using the group operation on $\GL(n,\RR)$ and since any open set of$\GL(n,\RR)$ is a union of open balls, everyopen subset of $\GL(n,\RR)$ is the imprint of some D-open subset of$\Diff(\RR^n)$.

By definition of the quotientdiffeology of $\G/\pi$, for all $r_0 \in \U$ there exist an open neighborhood$\V$ of $r_0$ and a plot $\gamma : \V \to \G$ such that $\P(r) = \gamma(r)(x)$ for all $r \in \V$. Hence, $\P \restriction \V = [r \mapsto (r,x) \mapsto \gamma(r)(x)]$, but $[r \mapsto (r,x)]$ is clearly  smooth, and $[(r,x) \mapsto \gamma(r)(x)]$ is smooth by the very definition of the functional diffeology. Thus, $\P \restriction \V$ is a plot of the subset diffeology. Therefore $j$ is smooth. The quotient diffeology of $\G(x)$ is finer than its subsetdiffeology.\alinea{2)} Let $\P : \U \to \cQ$ be a plot, let $r \in \U$ and $g \in \G$ such that $\pi(g) = \P(r)$, that is, $g(x) = \P(r)$. By definition of the quotient diffeology there exist an open neighborhood $\V$ of $r$ and a plot $\gamma : \V \to \G$ such that $\P \restriction \V = \pi \circ \gamma$. Let $g' = \gamma(r)$, then $\pi(g') = \pi(g) = \P(r)$, that is, $g(x) = g'(x)$ or  $g'^{-1}(g(x)) = x$.  Now, let us define on $\V$,$\gamma' = [s \mapsto \gamma(s) \circ g'^{-1} \circ g]$. On the one hand, we have $\gamma'(s)(x) = \gamma(s)(g'^{-1}(g(x)))$, but $g'^{-1}(g(x)) = x$, thus $\gamma'(s)(x) = \gamma(s)(x)$, that is, $\pi \circ \gamma' = \pi \circ \gamma = \P \restriction \V$. On the other hand we have $\gamma'(r) = \gamma(r) \circ g'^{-1} \circ g$, but $g' = \gamma(r)$, thus $\gamma'(r) = g$. Since, by definition of the functionaldiffeology of $\G$ \art{Functional-diffeology-on-groups-of-diffeomorphisms}, composition and inversion are smooth, the parametrization $\gamma'$ is a plot of$\G$. Moreover, $\gamma'$ satisfies the conditions$\P \restriction \V = \pi \circ \gamma'$ and $\gamma'(r) = g$. Therefore $\pi$ is a local subduction.\alinea{3)} By definition of generating families \art{Generating-diffeology}, a plot $\P$of the Tahar rug $\cT$ writes locally $[r \mapsto (t(r),c)]$ or $[r \mapsto (c,t(r))]$, where $c$ is some constant and $t$ is asmooth real function. Now, let $u =(a,b) \in \RR^2$, the composition $\T_u \circ \P$ writes locally either $[r \mapsto (t'(r),c')]$,with $t'(r) = t(r) +a$ and $c' = c+b$, or $[r \mapsto (c',t'(r))]$, with $t'(r) = t(r) + b$ and $c' = c + a$. Thus, $\T_u$ is smooth. Then, since$(\T_u)^{-1} = \T_{-u}$, $\T_u$ is a diffeomorphism of $\cT$. Now, let $r \mapsto u(r) =(a(r),b(r))$ be a parametrization of $\RR^2$ such that $r \mapsto \T_{u(r)}$ is a plot for the functional diffeology. Composed with the 1-plots $t \mapsto (t,c)$, where $c$ runs over $\RR$, we must get a plot $(r,t) \mapsto (t + a(r), c+b(r))$ of $\cT$, that is, a plot which is locally of the first or the second kind. Hence, either $(r,t) \mapsto t + a(r)$ is locally constant, or $(r,t) \mapsto c + b(r)$. But $(r,t) \mapsto t + a(r)$ is not locally constant because of its dependency on $t$, thus $(r,t) \mapsto c + b(r)$ is locally constant, that is, $b(r) =_\loc b$, for some$b \in \RR$. In the same way, composing with the 1-plots $t \mapsto (c,t)$, we get that $a(r) =_\loc a$. Therefore, $r \mapsto \T_{u(r)}$ is locally constant,that is, the group of translations, equipped with the functional diffeology, is discrete.Finally, the action of the translations on $\cT$ is free, the orbit of $(0,0)$ is$\cT$, and since the diffeology of $\cT$ is not the discrete diffeology, we get an example, for the first question, where the diffeology of $\cQ$ is strictly finer than the one of $\cO$.\endsolexref\solexref{A-not-so-strong-subduction}(A not so strong subduction)As an application of \art{Uniqueness-of-quotient}, the underlying set of$\cQ$ can be represented by the half line $[0,\infty[$ equipped withthe image of the diffeology of$\RR\coprod\RR^2$ by the map $p: x \mapsto \norm{x}^2$.%%###########\begin{figure}[tb]  \centerline{\includegraphics{Figures-PDF/fig-R1R2.pdf}}  \caption{The quotient $\cQ$}\label{quotientR1R2}\end{figure}%%###########Let $0$ and $(0,0)$ be the zeros of $\RR$ and $\RR^2$, and let $\P$ be the plot $p\restriction \RR^2$. Then, $\P(0,0) = 0 \in[0,\infty[$.

Let $r'_0 \in \U'$ and $r_0 = \F(r'_0)$. By hypothesis, for every $\Q_0 \in \cD$ suchthat $\Val(\Q_0) \subset \P(r_0) = \P'(r'_0)$, thereexist an open neighborhood $\V$ of $r_0$ and a smooth family of plots$\Q : \V \to \cD$ such that $\Q(r_0) = \Q_0$ and $\Val(\Q(r)) \subset \P(r)$, for all $r \in \V$. Let us then define $\V' = \F^{-1}(\V)$ and $\Q' = \Q \circ \F$.Since $\F$ is smooth, $\V'$ is a domain, and since $\Q$ is asmooth family of plots, so is $\Q \circ \F$. Thus, forevery $r'_0 \in \U'$, for every $\Q_0 \in \cD$ such that $\Val(\Q_0) \subset \P'(r'_0)$, we found a smooth family of plots $\Q'$ such that $\Q'(r'_0) = \Q(r_0) = \Q_0$ and $\Val(\Q'(r')) = \Val(\Q \circ \F(r')) = \Val(\Q(r)) \subset \P(r) = \P'(r')$, where $r = \F(r')$. Therefore, $\P' = \P \circ \F$ satisfies ($\clubsuit$).\alinea{2)} Consider now the relation $\cR$ from $\Powerset(\X)$ to $\cD$ defined by the inclusion$$ \cR = \{ (\A,\Q) \in \Powerset(\X) \times \cD \mid \Val(\Q) \subset \A \}.$$Let $\P : \U \to \Powerset(\X)$be a parametrization regarded as the relation $$\P = \{(r,\A) \in \U \times  \Powerset(\X) \mid \A = \P(r) \}.$$The composite $\cR \circ \P$, also denoted by $\P^*(\cR)$, is then given by$$ \P^*(\cR) = \{ (r, \Q) \in \U \times \cD \mid \Val(\Q) \subset \P(r) \}.$$The parametrization $\P$ is a plot of the powerset diffeology if and only ifthe first projection $\pr_1 : \P^*(\cR) \to \U$ is everywhere a local subduction.Now, if $f : \X \to \Y$ is a map between two diffeological spaces, $f$ is smoothif and only if the first projection from $\bmf = \{(x,y) \in \X \times \Y \mid y = f(x) \}$to $\X$ is a subduction, which is equivalent to be a local subduction, in this case. %Note that this construction gives an idea of what can be a {\em smooth relation}from a diffeological space $\X$ to another $\X'$. Indeed, let $\cR \subset \X \times \X'$ be a relation from $\X$ to $\X'$, we declare $\cR$ smooth if for every plot $\P$ in $\Dom(\cR) = \pr_1(\cR) \subset \X$,for every $r \in \U$ and every $(\P(r),x') \in \cR$, there exists a plot $\Q : \V \to \X'$, with $\V \subset \U$, such that $(\P(r'),\Q(r')) \in \cR$ for all $r' \in \V$ and $\Q(r) = x'$. In other words, $\pr_1 : \cR \to \Dom(\cR)$is a local subduction everywhere, where $\cR$ and  $\Dom(\cR)$ are equipped withthe subset diffeology. %With this terminology, back to the powerset diffeology, a parametrization $\P : \U \to \Powerset(\X)$is a plot if the composite $\cR \circ \P$ is a smooth relation from $\U$ to $\cD$.\alinea{3)} Let us check now that the map $j : x \mapsto \set{x}$ is an induction.We consider the criterion for \art{Criterion-for-being-an-induction}. First of all let us remark that $j$ in injective. Next, let us check thatthe map $j$ is smooth. Let $\P : \U \to \X$ be a plot.Thus, $j \circ \P(r) = \set{\P(r)}$. Let $r_0 \in \U$ and$\Q_0 \in \cD$ such that $\Val(\Q_0) \subset j \circ \P(r_0) = \set{\P(r_0)}$. So, $\Val(\Q_0)$ is the point $\P(r_0)$ of $\X$, that is,$\Q_0$ is the constant plot $s \mapsto \P(r_0)$. Let usthen define, for every $r \in \U$, $\Q(r)$ as theconstant plot $[s \mapsto \P(r)]$, with $\Dom(\Q(r)) = \Dom(\Q_0)$. Since, for every $r \in \U$, the parametrization $[(r,s) \mapsto \Q(r)(s) = \P(r)]$, defined on $\U \times \Dom(\Q_0)$,is clearly a plot of $\X$, then $\Q$ is a smooth family of plots of $\X$. Therefore, $j \circ \P$ is a plot of $\Powerset(\X)$, and $j$ issmooth.%Then, let us check that the map $j^{-1} : j(\X) \to \X$is smooth. Let $\P : \U \to j(\X)$ be a plot of thepowerset diffeology. First of all, for every $r \in \U$there exists a unique point $q(r) \in \X$ such that $\P(r) = \set{q(r)}$. Then, since $\P$is a plot of $\Powerset(\X)$, for all$r_0 \in \U$, for every plot $\Q_0$ of $\X$ such that$\Val(\Q_0) \subset \P(r_0) = \set{q(r_0)}$, thereexist an open neighborhood $\V$ of$r_0$, and a smooth family of plots $\Q$ of $\X$, such that $\Val(\Q(r)) \subset \P(r)$, for all $r \in \V$. Then, let us choose the $0$-plot$\Q_0 : \RR^0 \to \X$, with $\Q_0(0) = q(r_0)$, that is, $\Val(\Q_0) = \P(r_0)$. Thus, $\Q$ is necessarily a smooth family of $0$-plots (see \art{Functional-diffeology-of-a-diffeology}).But $\Val(\Q(r)) \subset \P(r) = \set{q(r)}$ means exactly that $\Q(r)(0) = q(r)$. Hence, $q \restriction \V = [r \mapsto \Q(r)(0)]$ is a plot of $\X$. Therefore, $q = j^{-1} \circ \P$ is a plot of $\X$, and $j^{-1}$ issmooth.Finally, thanks to the criterion\art{Criterion-for-being-an-induction}, $j$ is aninduction from $\X$ into $\Powerset(\X)$.\alinea{4)} Let us show, now, that the Tzim-Tzum $\cT$ is a plot of the powerset diffeology of $\Powerset(\RR^2)$. Let $t_0 \in\RR$ and consider$\cT_{t_0}$. Let $\Q_0 : \U \to \cT_{t_0}$ be a plot. If $t_0 < 0$,then we can choose $\Q(t)(r) = \Q_0(r)$ for $t \in \openinterval{3t_0/2,t_0/2}$. $\Q$ is a smooth family of plots of $\RR^2$ such that $\Q(t_0) = \Q_0$ and $\Val(\Q(t)) \subset \cT(t) = \RR^2$. For $t_0= 0$, we choose $\Q(t)(r) = (e^t + t/\norm{\Q_0(r)})\Q_0(r)$. Since $\cT(0) = \RR^2-\{0\}$, $\Q_0(r) \neq 0$ for all $r$, $\Q(t)$ is well defined and $\Q$ is a smooth family of plots of $\RR^2$. Next, note first that $\Q(0) = \Q_0$. Then, for $t \geq 0$, $\norm{\Q(t)(r)} = t + e^t \norm{\Q_0(r)} > t$, since$\norm{\Q_0(r)} > 0$, thus $\Val(\Q(t)) \subset \cT(t)$. For $t <0$ there isnothing to check since $\cT(t) = \RR^2$. Now, if $t_0 > 0$, we can choose $\Q(t)(r) = [1 + (t-t_0)/t_0]\Q_0(r)$. We have $\Q(t_0) = \Q_0$, then$\norm{\Q(t)(r)} = \vert 1 + (t-t_0)/t_0 \vert \norm{\Q_0(r)}$. But,$\norm{\Q_0(r)} > t_0$ implies $\norm{\Q(t)(r)} > \vert 1 + (t-t_0)/t_0 \vert t_0 = \vert t \vert$. Thus, if $t \geq 0$, then $\norm{\Q(t)(r)} > t$, for all $r$, that is, $\Val(\Q(t)) \subset \cT(t)$. We exhausted all the cases, and therefore $\cT$ is a plot of the powerset diffeology of $\Powerset(\RR^2)$. As we  can see, there is a blowing up for $t = 0$, the space opens up, an empty bubble appears and grows with it. This is the reason for which we named this plot Tzim-Tzum. \endsolexref\solexref{The-powerset-diffeology-of-the-set-of-lines}(The powerset diffeology of the set of lines)First of all let us note that, given a line $\DD \in  \Lines(\RR^n)$, the solution of the equation $j(u,x) = \DD$,with $(u,x) \in \T\S^{n-1}$, has exactly two solutions:$$  u = \pm{r-r' \over \norm{r-r'}} \qmbox{and} x = [\id -  u\bar u]r,   $$ where $r$ and $r'$ are any two differents points of$\DD$ and $[\id - u \bar u]$ is the projector orthogonal to $u$. Bydefinition: $\bar u(v) = u\cdot v$,  then $[\id - u \bar  u](v) = v - (u \cdot v) u$. %Let us prove now that the map $j$ is smooth. Let $\P : s  \mapsto (u(s),x(s))$ be a plot of $\T\S^{n-1}$, definedon some domain $\U$, that is, $\P$ is a smoothparametrization of $\RR^n \times \RR^n$ with values in$\T\S^{n-1}$. Let $\P' = j \circ \P : s \mapsto  x(s) + \RR u(s)$. We want to show that $\P'$ is aplot of $\Powerset(\RR^n)$. Let then $s_0 \in \U$, $u_0 =  u(s_0)$, $x_0 = x(s_0)$, $\DD_0 = \P'(s_0) =    j(u_0,x_0)$ and $\Q_0 : \W \to \DD_0$ be some smoothparametrization in $\DD_0$. Since $\Q_0$ is a plot of$\DD_0$, for any $w \in \W$, $\Q_0(w) - x_0$ isproportional to $u_0$, that is, $\Q_0(w) - x_0 = \tau  u_0$. But since $u_0 \cdot x_0 = 0$, $\Q_0(w) - x_0 = \tau    u_0$ implies $\tau = u_0 \cdot (\Q_0(w) - x_0) =      u_0 \cdot \Q_0(w)$. Hence,defining $\tau(w) = u_0 \cdot \Q_0(w)$, we get $\Q_0(w)  = x_0 + \tau(w) u_0$, where $\tau \in \Cinfty(\W,\RR)$.Let us define now$$  \Q = [s \mapsto [w \mapsto x(s) + \tau(w) u(s)]],  \qmbox{where} s \in \U \qmbox{and} w \in \W.  $$ Since $x$, $u$ and $\tau$ are smooth, $\Q$ is a plot ofthe diffeology of $\RR^n$ and satisfies $\Q(s_0) =  \Q_0$. Hence, $\P'$ is a plot of $\Powerset(\RR^n)$.Therefore, $j$ is smooth.%Let us now prove that $j$ is a subduction onto itsimage, that is, onto the space $\Lines(\RR^n)$. Let $\P : \U \to  \Lines(\RR^n)$ be a plot and $s_0 \in \U$. Since $\P(s_0)$ is aline of $\RR^n$, there exists $(u_0,x_0) \in \T\S^{n-1}$such that $\P(s_0) = x_0 + \RR u_0$. Let$\Q_0 = [t \mapsto x_0 + t u_0]$, with $t \in \RR$,$\Q_0$ is a plot of $\RR^n$ such that $\Val(\Q_0)  \subset \P(s_0)$. Hence, since $\P$ is a plot for thepowerset diffeology of $\RR^n$, there exist an open neighborhood$\V$ of $s_0$, and a plot $\Q$ of the smooth diffeologyof $\RR^n$, such that $\Q(s_0) = [t \mapsto x_0 + t u_0]$and $\Val(\Q(s)) \subset \P(s)$. Let us choose $t = 0  \in \Dom(\Q(s_0))$, since $\Q$ is a plot of the smoothdiffeology of $\RR^n$,there exists an open neighborhood $\W$ of $s_0$ and thereexists $\varepsilon > 0$ such that $(t,s) \mapsto  \Q(s)(t)$, defined on $\W \times    ]-\varepsilon, + \varepsilon[$, is smooth. Let usthen define, for all $s \in \W$,$$  v(s) = \left. {\partial  \Q(s)(t) \over \partial t} \right|_{t=0}. $$Since $\Q$ is smooth, the parametrization $v$ is smooth.We have $v(s_0) = u_0 \neq 0$. Thus, there exists an open neighborhood $\W'$ of $s_0$ on which $v$ does notvanish. Therefore, the map $$  u : s \mapsto {v(s) \over \norm{v(s)}}  $$is smooth on $\W'$. Moreover, by construction, $u(s)$directs the line $\P(s)$. Now, let  $$  x(s) = \Q(s)(0) - [u(s) \cdot \Q(s)(0)] u(s).  $$Since $\Q(s)(0) \in \P(s)$ and $u(s)$ directs $\P(s)$,the point $x(s)$ belongs to $\P(s)$, and by construction$u(s) \cdot x(s) = 0$. So, the parametrization of$\T\S^{n-1}$ defined by $ \phi : s \mapsto (u(s),x(s))$ issmooth and satisfies $j \circ \phi = \P$. Hence,$\phi$ is a local lift of $\P$ along $j$, defined on$\W'$. Combined with the surjectivity and thedifferentiability of $j$, this is the criterion for $j$to be a subduction\art{Criterion-for-being-a-subduction} from $\T\S^{n-1}$onto its image $\Lines(\RR^n)$. Therefore, the set of lines is diffeomorphic to the quotient $\T\S^{n-1}/\set{\pm 1}$, where $- 1$ acts by reversing the orientation,that is, $\pm(u,x) = (\pm u, x)$.\endsolexref%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% %% The dimension map of diffeological spaces%% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\SkipTocEntry\section*{The Dimension Map of Diffeological Spaces}\solexref{The-diffeomorphisms-of-the-half-line}(The diffeomorphisms of the half line) Let us prove firstthat any diffeomorphism $f$ of$\Delta_\infty = [0,\infty[ \subset \RR$ satisfies thethree points of the proposition.\alinea{1)} Since the dimension map is invariant under diffeomorphism \art{The-dimension-map-is-a-local-invariant} and since the origin is the only point where the dimension is infinite, as shownin\exref{Dimension-of-the-half-line}, $f$ fixes the origin, $f(0) = 0$. \alinea{2)} Since $f(0) = 0$ and $f$ is a bijection we have $f(\left]0, \infty  \right[) = \left]0, \infty \right[$.

Hence, the map $\varphi : t \mapsto f(t^2)$ defined on $\RR$with values in $\leftclosedinterval{0, \infty}$ is smooth. Now, by theorem 1 of\cite{Whi43}, since $\varphi$ is smooth, $f$ can be extended to an open neighborhood of$\leftclosedinterval{0, \infty}$ by a smooth function. Hence,$f$ is continuously differentiable at the origin. Moreover since $f$ is adiffeomorphism of $\Delta_\infty$, what has been said for $f$ can be said for$f^{-1}$. And, since $(f^{-1})'(0) = 1/f'(0)$ and $f$ is increasing, we have$f'(0) >0$.%Conversely, a function $f$ satisfying the three aboveconditions can be extended by a smooth function to someopen neighborhood of $[0,\infty[$. Hence,$f$ is the restriction to $\leftclosedinterval{0, \infty}$ of a smooth function $\tilde f$ such that: $\tilde    f(0) =0$, $\tilde f$ is strictly increasing on $\leftclosedinterval{0, \infty}$ and$\tilde f'(0) > 0$, then $f$ is smooth for the subsetdiffeology as well as its inverse, that is, $f$ is adiffeomorphism of $\Delta_\infty$.  \endsolexref%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% %% Diffeological vector spaces%% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\SkipTocEntry\section*{Diffeological Vector Spaces}\solexref{Vector-space-of-maps-into-Kn}(Vector space of maps into $\KK^n$)Let us recall that a parametrization $\P : \U \to \E =  \Cinfty(\X,\KK)$ is a plot for the functional diffeology ifand only if, for every plot $\Q : \V \to \X$, theparametrization $[(r,s) \mapsto \P(r)(\Q(s))]$ is a plotof $\KK^n$ \art{Functional-diffeologies}.

Let $\P: {\U} \to {\E}$ be a plot of ${\E}$.For every $r \in {\U}$, $\P(r) = \sum_{k = 1}^n  (\ee_k\cdot \P(r)) \ee_k$, since, byhypothesis, the maps $\P_k : r \mapsto \ee_k\cdot \P(r)$ are smooth, the plot $\P$ is a plot of the finediffeology.

The same argument holds for theHermitian case. %The \art{Standard-vector-spaces} states that the coarsediffeology is always a vector space diffeology. Forfinite dimensional spaces, the existence of a smootheucllidean structure reduces the set of vector spacediffeologies to the unique fine diffeology.

Hence,$\alpha(r) = 0$, $\beta(r) = 1$ and $\eL = \eF_r(\alpha,\beta)$. The fact that $g(r) \neq 0$ is a property of the line $\eL$, indeed for any other pair $(f',g')$defining the same line, $g' = \mu g$ with $\mu \neq 0$, and then $g'(r) \neq 0$.Let us denote this space, defined by $g(r) \neq 0$, by $\Lines_r(\cE)$. Thus,$\Val(\eF_r) = \Lines_r(\cE)$. Note next that $\eF_r$ is injective. Indeed, if $(\alpha_1, \beta_1)$ and $(\alpha_2, \beta_2)$ belong to $\cE^0_r \times \cE^1_r$and define the same line, then $\beta_2 = \mu \beta_1$, which implies $\mu = 1$,and $\alpha_2 = \alpha_1 + \lambda \beta_1$, which implies $\lambda = 0$.Therefore $\eF_r$ is a bijection from $\cE^0_r \times \cE^1_r$ onto its image $\Lines_r(\cE)$.Moreover, since $\eF_r$ is the restriction of a smooth map to $\cE^0_r \times \cE^1_r \subset \cE \times (\cE - \{0\})$, it is a smooth injection.Let us check now that $\eF_r$ is an induction. Let $u \mapsto \eL_u$ be a plot of $\Lines_r(\cE)$, there exists locally a smooth parametrization $u \mapsto (f_u,g_u)$ in$\cE \times (\cE - \{0\})$, with $g_u(r) \neq 0$, such that $\eL_u = \{f_u + s g_u \mid s \in \RR\}$. The map $(f_u,g_u) \mapsto (\alpha_u,\beta_u)$,defined by $\alpha_u = f_u - f_u(r) \beta_u$ and $\beta_u = g_u/g_u(r)$, being smooth,the parametrization $u \mapsto (\alpha_u,\beta_u)$ is a plot of $\cE^0_r \times \cE^1_r$ such that$\eL_u = \eF_r(\alpha_u,\beta_u)$. Therefore, $\eF_r$ is an induction. Finally, let us check that $\Lines_r(\cE)$ is D-open.

Since $(u,r) \mapsto g_u(r)$ is smooth, $\phi$ is smooth.Thus, $\P^{-1}(\cO_r) = \{ u \in \Dom(\P) \mid g_u(r) \neq 0\} = \phi^{-1}(\RR-0)$, is open.Therefore, $\cO_r$ is D-open and then $\eF_r$ is a local diffeomorphism from $\cE^0_r \times \cE^1_r$ to $\Lines(\cE)$, with values $\Lines_r(\cE)$.\alinea{2)} Since for every line $\eL$ there exists $(f,g)$ such that $\eL = \{ f + s g \mid s \in \RR \}$, with $g \neq 0$, there exists some $r \in \RR$ such that $g(r) \neq 0$, thus the union of all the subsets $\Lines_r(\cE)$ covers $\Lines(\cE)$.Now, every $\cE^0_r$ is isomorphic to $\cE^0_0$, by$\alpha \mapsto \alpha \circ \T_{r} = [r' \mapsto \alpha(r' +r)]$, and $\cE^1_r$ also is isomorphic (as an affine space) to $\cE^0_0$, by$\beta \mapsto  \beta \circ \T_{r} -1$. Therefore, $\Lines(\cE)$ is a diffeologicalmanifold modeled on $\cE^0_0 \times \cE^0_0$, where $\cE^0_0 = \{ f \in \Cinfty(\RR,\RR) \mid f(0) = 0 \}$.\alinea{2)} The space of maps from $\{1,2\}$ to $\RR$ is diffeomorphicto $\RR^2$. Let $f \simeq (x_1,x_2)$ and $g \simeq (u_1,u_2)$, $g \neq 0$ means that$(u_1,u_2) \neq (0,0)$. Now, there are four spaces $\cE_r^i$, where $r = 1,2$ and $i = 0,1$, that is, $\cE_1^0 = \{(0,x_2) \mid x_2 \in \RR \}$, $\cE_1^1 = \{(1,u_2) \mid x_2 \in \RR \}$, $\cE_2^0 = \{(x_1,0) \mid x_1 \in \RR \}$, $\cE_2^1 = \{(u_1,1) \mid u_1 \in \RR \}$. Thus, $$  \eF_1\left(\vect{0 \\ x_2}, \vect{1 \\ u_2}\right) = \left\{ \vect{s \\ x_2 + s u_2} \mid s \in \RR \right\}, $$ $$ \eF_2\left(\vect{x_1 \\ 0}, \vect{u_1 \\ 1}\right) =  \left\{ \vect{x_1 + s u_1 \\ s} \mid s \in \RR \right\}.$$The chart $\eF_1$ maps $\RR^2$ to the subspace of lines not parallel to the $x_2$-axis and the chart $\eF_2$ maps $\RR^2$ to the subspace of lines not parallel to the $x_1$-axis. We have seen that the set of unparametrized and non oriented lines in $\RR^2$ is diffeomorphic to the M\"obius strip, \exref{A-diffeology-for-the-space-of-lines}, question 4, thusthe set $\cA = \{ \eF_1,\eF_2\}$ is an atlas of this famous manifold.\endsolexref\solexref{The-Hopf-S1-bundle}(The Hopf $\S^1$-bundle)Let $\J : \cS_\CC \to \cH_\CC$ be the natural inclusion.Since $\J(z\times \Z) = z \times \J(\Z)$, the injection$\J$ projects onto a map $j : \cS_\CC/\U(1) \to \cP_\CC =  \cH_\CC^\star/\CC^\star$, according to the followingcommuting diagram,where $\pi_\cS$ and $\pi_\cH$ are the naturalprojections.Since $\J$ is smooth, and since $\pi_\cS$is a subduction, $j$ is smooth. The map$j$ is obiously injective. Then, since for every $\Z \in  \cH_\CC^\star$, $\Z/\norm{\Z} \in \cS_\CC$, $j$ issurjective. Now, since the map $\rho : \Z \mapsto  \Z/\norm{\Z}$ from $\cH_\CC^\star$ to $\cS_\CC$ is smooth($\Z \neq 0$), $j^{-1}$ is smooth. Indeed, a plot $\P$ of$\cP_\CC$ lifts locally to $\cH_\CC^\star$. Composingthe local lift with $\rho$ we get a lift in $\cS_\CC$.Therefore, $j$ is a diffeomorphism.%\begin{center}\begin{tikzpicture}[auto]  \node (A)  at (0,0) {$\cS_\CC$};  \node (B)  at (3.5,0) {$\cH_\CC^\star$};  \node (C)  at (0,-2) {$\cS_\CC/\U(1)$};  \node (D)  at (3.5,-2) {$\cP_\CC = \cH_\CC^\star/\CC^\star$};  \draw[->] (A) to node {$\J$} (B);  \draw[->] (A) to node [swap] {$\pi_\cS$} (C);  \draw[->] (B) to node {$\pi_\cH$} (D);  \draw[->] (C) to node [swap] {$j$} (D);\end{tikzpicture}\end{center}%Now, let us transpose this construction to $\cH_\RR  \times  \cH_\RR$. The sphere $\cS_\CC$ is diffeomorphicto the sphere $\cS = \set{(\X,\Y) \in  \cH_\RR \times \cH_\RR \mid \norm{\X}^2 + \norm{\Y}^2 =  1}$. The group $\U(1) = \set{z =    \cos(\theta) + i \sin(\theta) \mid \theta \in \RR}$ isequivalent to the group $$  \SO(2,\RR) = \left\{  \left(  \begin{array}{lr}  \cos(\theta) & - \sin(\theta) \\  \sin(\theta) & \cos(\theta)   \end{array}  \right)   \ \bigg\vert \ \theta \in \RR \right\}.   $$With this identification, the action of $\U(1)$ on$\cS_\CC$ transmutes to the following action of$\SO(2,\RR)$ on $\cS$,$$\left(  \begin{array}{lr}  \cos(\theta) & - \sin(\theta) \\  \sin(\theta) & \cos(\theta)   \end{array}  \right)  :   \vect{ \X \\ \Y} \mapsto  \left(  \begin{array}{lr}  \cos(\theta) & - \sin(\theta) \\  \sin(\theta) & \cos(\theta)   \end{array}  \right)  \vect{ \X \\ \Y}. $$ Hence, the projective space $\cP_\CC$ also is diffeomorphic to $\cS/\SO(2,\RR)$.\endsolexref\solexref{U1-as-subgroup-of-diffeomorphisms}($\U(1)$ as subgroup of diffeomorphisms)First of all, let us note that $j$ is an injectivehomomorphism (a monomorphism), $j(zz') = j(z)  \circ j(z')$, and $j(z)^{-1} = j(z^{-1})$. Moreover, $j$is $\CC$-linear, thus smooth\art{Linear-maps-and-fine-diffeology}. %Now, let $\P : \U  \to \U(1)$ be a parametrization such that $j \circ \P$is smooth for the functional diffeology of$\GL(\cH_\CC)$. Let us apply the criterionof\art{Functional-diffeology-between-fine-spaces}to the plot $j \circ \P$.  Let $r_0 \in \U$, let $\Z  \in \cH_\CC$, $\Z \neq 0$, and $\F = \CC \Z \subset    \cH_\CC$ be the complex line generated by $\Z$. There exist an open neighborhood $\V$ of $r_0$ and a finitedimensional subspace $\F' \subset \cH_\CC$ such that:$(j\circ \P) \restriction \V \in \Lin(\F,\F')$ and $r  \mapsto (j \circ \P(r)) \restriction \F$ is a plot of$\Lin(\F, \F')$. But clearly $\F' = \F$. Now, let $\cZ  : \CC \to \F$ be a basis, a $\CC$-linear isomorphism. Inthis basis, the parametrization $r \mapsto j(\P(r))$becomes the mutiplication by $\P(r)$, that is, $\cZ^{-1}  \circ j(\P(r)) \circ \cZ : z \mapsto \P(r) z$. Thus, $[r    \mapsto [z \mapsto \P(r) z]]$ being smooth means just that$\P : \U \to \U(1)$ is smooth. Therefore $j$ is aninduction. In other words, the multiplication by anelement of $\U(1)$ is a subgroup of $\U(\cH)$isomorphic, as diffeological group\art{Diffeological-groups}, to $\U(1)$. \endsolexref%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  Exercises %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\SkipTocEntry\section*{Modeling Diffeologies}\solexref{Reflexive-diffeologies}(Reflexive diffeologies)1) The coarsest diffeology $\cD$ is the intersection of the pullbacks of the smooth diffeology $\Cinfty_\star(\RR)$ of $\RR$, by the elements of the family $\cF$,$$ \cD = \bigcap_{f \in \cF} f^*(\Cinfty_\star(\RR)).$$The plots of this diffeology are explicitely defined by,\begin{itemize}\item[($\diamondsuit$)] $\P : \U \to \X$ belongs to $\cD$ if and only if, for all $f \in \cF$, $f \circ \P \in \Cinfty(\U,\RR)$.\end{itemize}Indeed, by definition of the pullback diffeology, $f^*(\Cinfty_\star(\RR))$ is the coarsest diffeology such that $f$ is smooth \art{Pullback-of-diffeologies}. Thus, every diffeology $\cD$ such that $\cF \subset \cD(\X,\RR)$ is contained in $f^*(\Cinfty_\star(\RR))$, and therefore,is contained in their intersection over the $f \in \cF$. Since the intersection of any family of diffeologies is a diffeology \art{Intersecting-diffeologies}, this intersection is a diffeology, and by construction, the coarsest.About the finest diffeology, we know that for the discrete diffeology on $\X$,$\Cinfty(\discrete{\X},\RR) = \Maps(\X,\RR)$, see\exref{Smooth-maps-from-discrete-spaces}. \alinea{2)} Let $\cD$ be the diffeology subordinated to $\cF$, and $\cD'$ be the diffeologysubordinated to $\cD(\X,\RR)$. By construction, $\cF \subset \cD(\X,\RR)$ and $\cD(\X,\RR) \subset \cD'(\X,\RR)$, then$\cF \subset \cD'(\X,\RR)$, but $\cD$ is the coarsest diffeology such that $\cF \subset \cD(\X,\RR)$, thus $\cD' \subset \cD$. Then,by definition of $\cD(\X,\RR)$, for all $\phi \in \cD(\X,\RR)$,for all plots $\P \in \cD$, $\phi \circ \P$ is smooth. But this is exactly the condition ($\diamondsuit$) for $\P$ to belong to $\cD'$, so$\cD \subset \cD'$. Therefore $\cD' = \cD$,and the diffeology subordinated to $\cF$ is reflexive.\alinea{3)} Let $\X$ be a manifold, $\cD$ be its diffeology, and $n = \dim(\X)$. Let us prove first that for every $x_0 \in \X$ and every local smooth function $f : \cO' \to \RR$, defined on an D-open neighborhood $\cO'$ of $x_0$, there exists a smooth function $\bar f : \X \to \RR$ which coincideswith $f$ on a D-open neighborhood $\cO \subset \cO'$ of $x_0$. Indeed, let $\F : \V \to \X$ be a chart of $\X$, and $\xi_0 \in \V$, such that $\F(\xi_0) = x_0$. We can assume that $\F(\V) \subset \cO'$. There exist two balls $\cB \subset \cB' \subset \V$, centered at $\xi_0$, and a smooth real function $\varepsilon : \V \to \RR$ such that $\varepsilon$ is equal to $1$ on $\cB$ and equal to $0$ outside $\cB'$. Then, the local real function $x \mapsto \varepsilon(\F(x)) \times f(x)$, defined on $\F(\V) \subset \cO'$, can be extended smoothly on $\X$ by $0$. This extension $\bar f$ coincides with $f$ on $\cO = \F(\cB)$.%Now, let $\P : \U \to \X$ be an element of $\cD'$, $r_0 \in \U$, and $x_0 = \P(r_0)$. Let $\F : \V \to \X$ be a chart, such that $\F(\xi_0) = x_0$.The cochart $\F^{-1} : x \mapsto (\phi_1(x), \cdots, \phi_n(x))$is made with local smooth functions $\phi_i$. Thus, the $\bar \phi_i \circ \P$ are smooth, by definition of $\cD'$. Then, there exists a small neighborhood $\W \subset \U$ of$r_0$ such that the $\phi_i \circ (\P \restriction \W)$ are smooth. By construction,$\P \restriction \W =  \F \circ \Q$, where$\Q : \W \to \Dom(\F)$ is the smooth parametrization $\Q : r \mapsto (\phi_1 \circ \P(r), \ldots, \phi_n \circ \P(r))$. Hence, locally $\P$ belongs to $\cD$, which implies $\P \in \cD$.Therefore, $\cD' \subset \cD$ and $\X$ is reflexive.\alinea{4)} We know that $\Cinfty(\Torus_\alpha,\RR)$ is reduced to the constantswhen $\alpha \notin \QQ$, see \exref{Diffeomorphisms-between-irrational-tori}. Thus, the subordinated diffeology to $\Cinfty(\Torus_\alpha,\RR)$ is the coarse diffeology, since the composite of a constant map with any parametrization is constant. But we also know that $\Torus_\alpha$ is not trivial. Therefore $\Torus_\alpha$is not reflexive.\endsolexref\solexref{Frolicher-spaces}(Fr\"olicher spaces)We assume $\X$ reflexive.

This gives, at the same time,$\cC \subset \fC(\cF)$ and $\cF \subset \fF(\cC)$. Next, let $c \in \fC(\cF)$, that is,for all $f \in \cF$, $f \circ c \in \Cinfty(\RR,\RR)$, but that means that $c \in \cD(\RR,\X)$, where $\cD$ denotes the diffeology subordinated to $\cF$,\exref{Reflexive-diffeologies}. Butsince $\X$ is reflexive,$\cD(\RR,\X) = \Cinfty(\RR,\X)$, and then $c \in  \Cinfty(\RR,\X)$.Thus, if $c \in \fC(\cF)$ then$c \in  \cC$, that is, $\fC(\cF) \subset \cC$. Therefore,$\fC(\cF) = \cC$. Consider now $f \in \fF(\cC)$, that is, $f \in \Maps(\X,\RR)$ such thatfor all $c \in \Cinfty(\RR, \X)$, $f \circ c \in \Cinfty(\RR,\RR)$. Let $\P \in \Cinfty(\RR^n, \X)$. Since $\P$ is a plot, for all$\gamma \in \Cinfty(\RR,\RR^n)$, $\P \circ \gamma \in \Cinfty(\RR,\X)$, thus $f \circ \P \circ \gamma \in \Cinfty(\RR,\RR)$, let $\F = f \circ \P : \RR^n \to \RR$, then  $\F \circ \gamma \in \Cinfty(\RR,\RR)$, for all $\gamma \in \Cinfty(\RR,\RR^n)$.By application of Boman's theorem, we get $\F \in \Cinfty(\RR^n,\RR)$, that is,$\P \circ \F \in \Cinfty(\RR^n,\RR)$. Then, after localization, see\exref{Global-plots-as-generating-families}, it comes that for every plot $\P$ of $\X$, $f \circ \P$ is smooth, that is, $f \in \Cinfty(\X,\RR)$. Thus $\fF(\cC) \subset \cF$, and then $\fF(\cC) = \cF$. Therefore, for every reflexive diffeological space $\X$, $\cC = \Cinfty(\RR,\X)$ and $\cF = \Cinfty(\X,\RR)$ satisfy the Fr\"olicher condition.\endsolexref%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  Exercises %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\SkipTocEntry\section*{Connectedness and Homotopy Category}\solexref{Connecting-points}(Connecting points)We know that $\X$ is diffeomorphic to $\Cinfty(\{0\},\X)$ \art{Iterating-paths}. Thus, the functor $\pi_0$ \art{The-homotopy-category} gives an isomorphism.\endsolexref\solexref{Connecting-segments}(Connecting segments)If $x$ and $x'$ are connected, then they satisfy obviously the condition of the exercise.Conversely, let $\sigma : \openinterval{a',b'} \to \X$ such that $\sigma(a) = x$,$\sigma(b) = x'$ and $a' < a < b < b'$.

This map is well defined. Indeed, if $\ell$ and $\ell'$ are fixed-ends homotopic then they are {\em a fortiori\/} free-ends homotopic, or if we prefer, sincethe injection $\Loops(\X,x) \subset \Loops(\X)$ is smooth, it inducesa natural map $\pr_x : \pi_0(\Loops(\X,x)) \to \pi_0(\Loops(\X))$.First, let us check that this map is surjective.Let $\ell' \in \Loops(\X)$ and $x' = \ell'(0)$, since $\X$ is connected thereexists a path $\gamma$ connecting $x$ to $x'$. We can consider $\ell'$ and $\gamma$ stationary since we know that every path is fixed-ends homotopicto a stationary path \art{Homotopy-of-paths}.Let us consider $\ell = \gamma \vee \ell' \vee \bar\gamma$ with $\bar\gamma(t) = \gamma(1-t)$, thus $\ell \in \Loops(\X,x)$. Now, let$\gamma_s(t) = \gamma(s + t(1 -s))$, $\gamma_s$ is a path connecting $\gamma_s(0) = \gamma(s)$ to $\gamma_s(1) = x'$, and $\ell_s = \gamma_s \vee \ell' \vee \bar\gamma_s$ is a free-ends homotopy connecting $\ell_0 = \gamma \vee \ell' \vee \bar\gamma = \ell$ to $\ell_1 = \bmx' \vee \ell' \vee \bmx'$,where $\bmx'$ is the constant path at $x'$. Now, $\bmx' \vee \ell' \vee \bmx'$is homotopic to $\ell'$, then $\ell$ and $\ell'$ belong to the same connected component in $\Loops(\X)$, thus $\comp(\ell) = \comp(\ell')$,that is, $\pr_x(\comp_x(\ell)) = \comp(\ell')$. Next, let $k_0$ and $k_1$ in $\pi_1(\X,x)$, let us prove that $\pr_x(k_0) = \pr_x(k_1)$ implies $k_0 = \tau \cdot k_1 \cdot \tau^{-1}$, for some $\tau \in \pi_1(\X,x)$.Let $k_0 = \comp_x(\ell_0)$ and$k_1 = \comp_x(\ell_1)$, with $\ell_0$ and $\ell_1$ in $\Loops(\X,x)$. Let us assume that$\pr_x(k_0) = \pr_x(k_1)$, that is, $\ell_0$ and $\ell_1$ are free-ends homotopic,in other words, $\comp(\ell_0) = \comp(\ell_1)$. Let $s \mapsto \ell_s$ be a free-ends homotopy, thus$\ell' : s \mapsto \ell_s(0)=\ell_s(1)$ is a loop based at $x$. Indeed, $\ell'(0) = \ell_0(0) =x$ and $\ell'(1) = \ell_1(0) = x$, that is,$\ell' \in \Loops(\X,x)$. Then, $\ell'_s : t \mapsto \ell'(st)$ is a path, connecting $\ell'_s(0) = \ell'(0) = \ell_0(0) = x$ to $\ell'_s(1) = \ell'(s) = \ell_s(0) = \ell_s(1)$. Hence, $\sigma_s = \ell'_s \vee \ell_s \vee \bar\ell'_s$ is a loop based at $x$, for all $s$. Thus, $\sigma$ is a fixed-ends homotopy connecting $\sigma_0 = \bmx \vee \ell_0 \vee \bmx$ to $\sigma_1 = \ell' \vee \ell_1 \vee \bar\ell'$, \ie\/,$\comp_x(\sigma_0) = \comp_x(\sigma_1)$. Since $\sigma_0$ is fixed-ends homotopic to $\ell_0$, and since $\ell' \in \Loops(\X,x)$, that writes again $\comp_x(\ell_0) = \comp_x(\ell' \vee \ell_1 \vee \bar\ell')$, that is,$k_0 = \tau \cdot k_1 \cdot \tau^{-1}$with $\tau = \comp_x(\ell')$. Therefore, $k_0$ and $k_1$ are conjugate. Conversely, let us check that $\pr_x(k) = \pr_x(\tau \cdot k \cdot \tau^{-1})$,where $k$ and $\tau$ belong to $\pi_1(\X,x)$. Let $k = \comp_x(\ell)$ and$\tau = \comp_x(\ell')$, with $\ell$ and $\ell'$ in $\Loops(\X,x)$. Then, $\pr_x(k) = \comp(\ell)$ and $\pr_x(\tau \cdot k \cdot \tau^{-1}) = \comp(\ell' \vee \ell \vee \bar\ell')$.Let us define $\gamma_s : t \mapsto \ell'(s + t(1-s))$, $\gamma_s$ is a path in $\X$satisfying $\gamma_s(0) = \ell'(s)$ and $\gamma_s(1) = \ell'(1) = x$. Then,since $\gamma_s(1) = \ell(0) = x$ and $\ell(1) = \bar\gamma_s(0)=x$,$\sigma_s = \gamma_s \vee \ell \vee \bar\gamma_s$ is well defined. Now,$\sigma_s(0) = \gamma_s(0) = \ell'(s)$ and $\sigma_s(1) = \bar\gamma_s(1) = \gamma_s(0) = \ell'(s)$, thus $\sigma_s \in \Loops(\X)$.Next, $\sigma_0 = \gamma_0 \vee \ell \vee \bar\gamma_0 = \ell' \vee \ell \vee \bar\ell'$and $\sigma_1 = \gamma_1 \vee \ell \vee \bar\gamma_1 = \bmx \vee \ell \vee \bmx$.Hence, we got a path $s \mapsto \sigma_s$ in $\Loops(\X)$ connecting $\ell' \vee \ell \vee \bar\ell'$to $\bmx \vee \ell \vee \bmx$, that is, $\comp(\ell' \vee \ell \vee \bar\ell') = \comp(\bmx \vee \ell \vee \bmx)$, but since $\comp(\bmx \vee \ell \vee \bmx) = \comp(\ell)$,$\comp(\ell' \vee \ell \vee \bar\ell') = \comp(\ell)$. Therefore,$\pr_x(\tau \cdot k \cdot \tau^{-1}) = \pr_x(k)$.Eventually, the map$\pr_x : \pi_1(\X,x) \to \pi_0(\Loops(\X))$ projects onto a bijection betweenthe set of conjugacy classes of $\pi_1(\X,x)$ and$\pi_0(\Loops(\X))$. Note thatthe fact that not all the paths, in the proof, are {\em a priori\/} stationary, can be addressed by using the smashing function introduced in \art{Homotopy-of-paths} wherever we need. Note also that, if the group$\pi_1(\X,x)$ is Abelian, then $\pi_0(\Loops(\X)) = \pi_1(\X,x)$, in particularwhen $\X = \G$ is a diffeological group.Let us consider now the inclusion $\Loops(\X,x) \subset \Loops(\X)$ and let us choose $\ell \in \Loops(\X,x)$.

But that is the definition of the pullback. Therefore,$\Lambda(\P\circ \F\restriction \V') = \F^*(\Lambda(\P  \restriction \V))$. Then, since this is true locally, and sinceit is a local property, it is true globally and$\Lambda(\P\circ \F) = \F^*(\Lambda(\P))$.\endsolexref\solexref{The-complex-picture-of-the-Liouville-form}(The complex picture of the Liouvilleform) The identity is obtained just by developing thecomputation as follows, \begin{eqnarray*}  (\Z\cdot d\Z -d\Z\cdot \Z)(\P) & = & \sum_{\alpha \in \A} \lambda^*_\alpha (\X_\alpha - i\Y_\alpha) \sum_{\beta \in \A} d\lambda_\beta (\X_\beta + i\Y_\beta) \\  & - & \sum_{\alpha \in \A} d\lambda^*_\alpha (\X_\alpha - i\Y_\alpha) \sum_{\beta \in \A} \lambda_\beta (\X_\beta + i\Y_\beta) \\  & = & \sum_{\alpha,\beta \in \A} \lambda^*_\alpha d\lambda_\beta [\X_\alpha \X_\beta + \Y_\alpha \Y_\beta +i(\X_\alpha \Y_\beta - \Y_\alpha \X_\beta)]\\  & - & \sum_{\alpha,\beta \in \A} d\lambda^*_\alpha \lambda_\beta [\X_\alpha \X_\beta + \Y_\alpha \Y_\beta +i(\X_\alpha \Y_\beta - \Y_\alpha \X_\beta)]\\  & = & \sum_{\alpha,\beta \in \A} (\X_\alpha \X_\beta + \Y_\alpha \Y_\beta) (\lambda^*_\alpha d\lambda_\beta - d\lambda^*_\alpha \lambda_\beta) \\  & + & i\sum_{\alpha,\beta \in \A} (\X_\alpha \Y_\beta - \Y_\alpha \X_\beta) (\lambda^*_\alpha d\lambda_\beta - d\lambda^*_\alpha \lambda_\beta).\end{eqnarray*}But $\sum_{\alpha,\beta \in \A} (\X_\alpha \X_\beta +  \Y_\alpha \Y_\beta) (\lambda^*_\alpha d\lambda_\beta -  d\lambda^*_\alpha \lambda_\beta) = 0$ for symmetryreasons. Hence, developing, for each index,$\lambda_\alpha = a_\alpha + i b_\alpha$, we get\begin{eqnarray*} (\Z\cdot d\Z -d\Z\cdot \Z)(\P) & = &  i\sum_{\alpha,\beta \in \A} (\X_\alpha \Y_\beta -  \Y_\alpha \X_\beta) (\lambda^*_\alpha d\lambda_\beta -  d\lambda^*_\alpha \lambda_\beta) \\  & = & i\sum_{\alpha,\beta \in \A} (\X_\alpha \Y_\beta -  \Y_\alpha \X_\beta) (a_\alpha da_\beta   - a_\beta da_\alpha +b_\alpha db_\beta  - b_\beta db_\alpha) \\  & - & \phantom{i} \sum_{\alpha,\beta \in \A} (\X_\alpha  \Y_\beta - \Y_\alpha \X_\beta) (a_\alpha db_\beta + a_\beta  db_\alpha -  b_\alpha da_\beta - b_\beta da_\alpha ).\end{eqnarray*} But the second term of the right hand side vanishesfor symmetry reasons. Thus, it remains \begin{eqnarray*}  (\Z\cdot d\Z -d\Z\cdot \Z)(\P) &= & i\sum_{\alpha,\beta \in  \A} (\X_\alpha \Y_\beta - \Y_\alpha \X_\beta) (a_\alpha  da_\beta - a_\beta da_\alpha) \\  & + & i\sum_{\alpha,\beta \in  \A} (\X_\alpha \Y_\beta - \Y_\alpha \X_\beta) (b_\alpha  db_\beta - b_\beta db_\alpha).\end{eqnarray*} Let us now come back to the map $\Phi : \Z \mapsto (\X,  \Y)$, identifying $\cH_\CC$ and $\cH_{\RR} \times    \cH_{\RR}$. The plot $\Phi \circ \P$ writes necessarily$\Phi \circ \P (r) = \sum_{j \in \cJ} \mu_j(r) (\X_j,  \Y_j)$. Then, developing $\sum_{\alpha \in \A}    \lambda_\alpha \Z_\alpha$, we obtain the family$(\mu_j,(\X_j, \Y_j))_{j\in \cJ}$ as the union of twofamilies: $$  (\mu_j,(\X_j, \Y_j))_{j\in  \cJ} = (a_\alpha,(\X_\alpha, \Y_\alpha)_{\alpha \in \A}  \bigcup \ (b_\alpha,(-\Y_\alpha, \X_\alpha)_{\alpha \in  \A}. $$Applying the form $\Lambda$ to $\Phi \circ \P$, for thisfamily, we get\begin{eqnarray*}   \Lambda(\Phi \circ \P)& =& \sum_{\alpha,\beta \in  \A} (\X_\alpha \Y_\beta - \Y_\alpha \X_\beta) (a_\alpha  da_\beta - a_\beta da_\alpha) \\  & + & \sum_{\alpha,\beta \in  \A} (-\Y_\alpha \X_\beta + \X_\alpha \Y_\beta) (b_\alpha  db_\beta - b_\beta db_\alpha).\end{eqnarray*} Comparing the last two expressions we get$\Lambda(\Phi \circ \P) = (1/2i) (\Z\cdot d\Z -d\Z\cdot  \Z)(\P)$. Thanks to locality\art{Differential-forms-are-local}, this equality isstill satisfied for any plot of $\cH_{\RR} \times  \cH_\RR$. Hence, we can conclude that$$   \Phi^*(\Lambda) = {1\over 2i}[\Z\cdot d\Z  -d\Z\cdot \Z].   $$\endsolexref\solexref{The-Fubini-Study-2-form}(The Fubini-Study $2$-form)We use the notations of\exref{The-complex-picture-of-the-Liouville-form}, and$j(z)$ denotes the multiplication $\Z \mapsto z\Z$. \alinea{1)} We have $$  j(z)^*(\varpi) ={1 \over 2i}[(z\Z) \cdot  d(z\Z) -  d(z\Z) \cdot (z\Z)].$$ But since $z \in \U(1)$, $z^*z = 1$, thus $(z\Z) \cdot  d(z\Z) = \Z \cdot d\Z$, as well $d(z\Z) \cdot (z\Z) =    d\Z \cdot \Z$. Therefore, $j(z)^*(\varpi) = \varpi$.\alinea{2)} Let $\P : \cO \to \cS_\CC$ and $\P' : \cO \to \cS_\CC$ be twoplots such that $\pi \circ \P = \pi \circ \P'$. Bydefinition of $\pi$,  there exists a uniqueparametrization $\zeta : \cO \to \U(1)$ such that$\P'(r) = \zeta(r) \times \P(r)$. We have to check that$\zeta$ is smooth. Since $\P$ and $\P'$ are plots of thefine diffeology, for every $r_0 \in \cO$ there existtwo local families\art{The-fine-diffeology-of-vector-spaces}$(\lambda_\alpha, \Z_\alpha)_{\alpha \in \A}$ and$(\lambda'_{\alpha'}, \Z'_{\alpha'})_{\alpha' \in \A'}$,defined on some open neighborhood $\V$ of $r_0$, such that$\P(r) =_\loc \sum_{\alpha \in \A} \lambda_\alpha(r)  \Z_\alpha$ and $\P'(r) =_\loc \sum_{\alpha' \in \A'}    \lambda_{\alpha'}(r) \Z'_{\alpha'}$. Moreover, the$\Z_\alpha$ and the $\Z'_{\alpha'}$ can be chosen asbases of the vector subspaces, $\F$ and $\F'$,they generate \art{Generating-the-fine-diffeology}. Then,let us consider a basis $\cZ''  = (\Z''_{\alpha''})_{\alpha'' \in \A''}$ of the sum $\F''    = \F + \F'$. The condition $\P'(r) = \zeta(r) \times      \P(r)$ writes in the basis $\cZ''$,$$  \sum_{\beta'' \in \A''} \lambda'_{\beta''}(r)  \Z''_{\beta''} = \zeta(r) \times \sum_{\beta'' \in  \A''} \lambda_{\beta''}(r) \Z_{\beta''},$$where the $\lambda_{\beta''}(r)$ and$\lambda'_{\beta''}(r)$ are the coordinates of $\P(r)$and $\P'(r)$ in the basis $\cZ''$. Thus, for every$\beta'' \in \A''$, we have $$  \lambda'_{\beta''}(r) = \zeta(r) \times  \lambda_{\beta''}(r).   $$But $\P(r)$ and $\P'(r)$ never vanish. There exists thensome index $\beta'' \in \A''$ for which$\lambda'_{\beta''}(r_0) \neq 0$. Since the function$\lambda'_{\beta''}$ is a smooth parametrization of$\CC$, there exists an open neighborhood $\W \subset \V$ of$r_0$ such that $\lambda'_{\beta''}(r) \neq 0$ for all $r  \in \W$. Therefore, $\lambda_{\beta''}(r) \neq 0$for all $r \in \W$. Thus, for all $r \in \W$, andfor this index $\beta''$, $\zeta(r)  = \lambda'_{\beta''}(r) /   \lambda_{\beta''}(r)$. Hence, the function$\zeta$ is locally smooth. Therefore, $\zeta$ is smooth. \alinea{3)} Let us define $d\P(r)$ by its local expression$\sum_{\alpha \in \A} d\lambda_\alpha(r)  \Z_\alpha$. Then, the form $\varpi$ evaluated on the plot$\P$, writes$$  \varpi(\P)(r) = {1 \over 2i}[\P(r) \cdot d\P(r) - d\P(r)  \cdot \P(r)].  $$Evaluated on the plot $\P' : r \mapsto \zeta(r)  \P(r)$, we have$$  \varpi( \P')(r) = {1 \over 2i}[(\zeta(r)\P(r))  \cdot d(\zeta(r)\P(r)) - d(\zeta(r)\P(r)) \cdot  (\zeta(r)\P(r))].   $$After developing this expression, we get\begin{eqnarray*}  \varpi(\P')(r) & = & {1 \over 2i}[\P(r) \cdot  d\P(r) - d\P(r) \cdot \P(r)] +{1 \over 2i}[ \zeta(r)^*  d\zeta(r) - d(\zeta(r)^*) \zeta(r)] \\  &=& \varpi(\P) + {1 \over 2i}[ \zeta(r)^*  d\zeta(r) - d(\zeta(r)^*) \zeta(r)].\end{eqnarray*}But using $\zeta(r)^* = 1/ \zeta(r)$, we get$$  \varpi(\zeta \P)(r) = \varpi(\P)(r) + {d\zeta(r)  \over i \zeta(r)}. $$Then, since $d\zeta(r)/( i \zeta(r))$ is just$\zeta^*(\theta)(r)$, we get $\varpi(\P') = \varpi(\P) +  \zeta^*(\theta)$.\alinea{4)} Now, since $d\theta = 0$, we have$$  d[\varpi(\P')] = d[\varpi(\P) + \zeta^*(\theta)]   = d[\varpi(\P)] + \zeta^*(d\theta) = d[\varpi(\P)].$$Thus, by application of criterion\art{Pushing-forms-onto-quotients}, there exists a $2$-form $\omega$ on $\cP_\CC = \cS_\CC/ \U(1)$, such that$\pi^*(\omega) = d\varpi$. Since $d[\pi^*(\omega)] = dd\varpi =0$, and thanks to\art{Vanishing-forms-on-quotients}, $d\omega=0$.\endsolexref\solexref{Irrational-tori-are-orientable}(Irrational tori are orientable)Let us consider two plots $\P: {\U} \to \RR^n$ and$\P': {\U} \to \RR^n$ such that $\pi_\Gamma  \circ \P = \pi_\Gamma \circ \P'$. Thus, the map $r    \mapsto \P'(r) - \P(r)$ takes its values in$\Gamma$, but since $\Gamma$ is discrete in $\RR^n$,and $\P'- \P$ is smooth, the map $\P'- \P$ islocally constant. Then, there exist an open neighborhood${\V}$ of $r$ and an element $\gamma \in \Gamma$ suchthat $\P'\restriction {\V} = \tau_\gamma \circ  \P \restriction {\V}$, where $\tau_\gamma$ is thetranslation by $\gamma$. Hence, $(\P'\restriction  {\V})^*(\vol_n) = (\tau_\gamma \circ {\P}\restriction  {\V})^*(\vol_n) = ({\P}\restriction  {\V})^*(\tau_\gamma^*(\vol_n)) = ({\P}\restriction  {\V})^*(\vol_n)$. Since ${\P}^*(\vol_n)$ and${\P}'^*(\vol_n)$ coincide locally they coincideglobally. Now, byapplication of \art{Pushing-forms-onto-quotients}, thereexists an $n$-form $\vol_\Gamma \in  \Omega^n({\T}_{\Gamma})$ such that$\pi_\Gamma^*(\vol_\Gamma) = \vol_n$. Since $\vol_n$does not vanish anywhere, $\vol_\Gamma$ does not vanishanywhere \art{Vanishing-forms-on-quotients}, and$\vol_\Gamma$ is a volume of the torus ${\T}_{\Gamma}$.Hence, the torus ${\T}_{\Gamma}$ is orientable.%Now, let $\vol$ be another volume on $\T_\Gamma$. Itspullback $\pi_\Gamma^*(\vol)$ is a volume of $\RR^n$. Thus,there exists a smooth real function $f$ on $\RR^n$ suchthat $\pi_\Gamma^*(\vol) = f \times \vol_n$\art{Volumes-on-manifolds-and-diffeological-spaces}. Butthanks to the invariance of $\pi_\Gamma^*(\vol)$ and$\vol_n$ under the action of $\Gamma$, the function $f$also is invariant by $\Gamma$. Hence, since $\Gamma$ isassumed to be dense, the function $f$ is constant and$\vol = c \times \vol_\Gamma$, with $c \in \RR$.\endsolexref%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% %% Forms bundles on diffeological spaces%% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\SkipTocEntry\section*{Forms Bundles on Diffeological Spaces}\solexref{The-k-forms-bundle-on-a-real-domain}(The $k$-forms bundle on a real domain)For the first question, $\P : \V \to \Omega^k(\U)$ is smooth if for all plots$\Q : \W \to \U$, $(r,s) \mapsto [\P(r)(\Q)](s)$, defined on $\V \times \W$ is smooth. In particular,for $\Q = \id_\U$ that gives $(r,x) \mapsto [\P(r)(\id_\U)](x) = (r,x) \mapsto a_r(x)$smooth, where $a_r(x) \in \Lambda^k(\RR^n)$. Now, $(r,s) \mapsto [\P(r)(\Q)](s) = [\P(r)(\id_\U \circ \Q)](s) = \Q^*(\P(r)(\id_U))(s) = \Q^*(a_r)(s)$,hence, since pullback preserves smoothness, if $(r,x) \mapsto a_r(x)$ is smooth, then $(r,s) \mapsto \Q^*(a_r)(s)$ alsois smooth. Therefore, $\P$ is smooth if and only if $(r,x) \mapsto a_r(x)$ is smooth. For the second question, the condition $\alpha_x = \beta_x$ means that $\alpha(\Q)(0) = \beta(\Q)(0)$ for all plots $\Q : \V \to \U$ centered at $x$, that is, $\Q(0) = x$. In particular,for $\Q = \T_x$, where $\T_x$ is the translation $x' \mapsto x' + x$, $\alpha(\T_x)(0) = \beta(\T_x)(0)$, that is, $\T_x^*(\alpha(\id_\U))(0) = \T_x^*(\beta(\id_\U))(0)$, which gives $a(x) = b(x)$.Conversely, for every $k$-uple of vectors of $\RR^n$, denoted by $[v_i]$, $\alpha(\Q)(0)[v_i] = \Q^*(a)(0)[v_i] = a(x)[\D(\Q)(0)(v_i)]$.Thus, if $a(x) = b(x)$, then $\alpha(\Q)(0)= \beta(\Q)(0)$ and $\alpha_x = \beta_x$. Therefore, the value of a $k$-form $\alpha$ on $\U$ at the point $x$ is defined by the value $a(x) = \alpha(\id_\U)(x) \in \Lambda^k(\RR^n)$. Since for every$a \in \Lambda^k(\RR^n)$ we can choose the constant form $a(x) = a$, every$a \in \Lambda^k(\RR^n)$ is the value of some smooth $k$-form  $\alpha$ on $\U$, and $\Lambda^k_x(\U) \simeq \Lambda^k(\RR^n)$. For the third question, note firstthat the map $\phi$ is well defined, we have seen that if $\alpha_x = \beta_x$, then$a(x) = b(x)$. Now, let $\P : \V \to \Forms^k(\U)$ be a plot, and let$\Q : \W \to \U \times \Omega^k(\U)$ be a smooth local lift of $\P$ along the projection $\pi : \U \times \Omega^k(\U) \to \Forms^k(\U)$, defined by $\pi(x,\alpha) = (x,\alpha_x)$. Let $\Q(r) = (x_r, \A(r))$ and $a_r = \A(r)(\id_\U)$, then  $\phi \circ (\P \restriction \W) = \phi \circ \pi \circ \Q$ gives$\phi(\P(r)) = (x_r,\A(r)(\id_\U)(x_r)=a_r(x_r))$. Since $\A : \W \to \Omega^k(\U)$ is smooth, $r \mapsto a_r = \A(r)(\id_\U)$ is smooth, and since $r \mapsto x_r$ issmooth, $r \mapsto a_r(x_r)$ is smooth. Therefore $\phi \circ (\P \restriction \W)$ is smooth, which implies that $\phi \circ \P$ is smooth, and therefore $\phi$.Conversely, let $\P : r \mapsto (x_r,a_r)$ be a plot of $\U \times \Lambda^k(\RR^n)$,let $\bma_r$ be the constant $k$-form on $\U$ with value $a_r$. Then, $\phi^{-1}(x_r,a_r) = \pi(x_r, \bma_r)$, and since $r \mapsto x_r$, $\pi$ and $r \mapsto \bma_r$ are smooth, $\phi^{-1} \circ \P$ is smooth. Therefore, $\phi$ is a diffeomorphism.\endsolexref\solexref{The-p-forms-bundle-on-a-manifold}(The $p$-form bundle on a manifold)For the first question, let $x \in \U$, we can choose $\varepsilon > 0$ such thatthe ball $\B(x,\varepsilon)$ is strictly contained in $\U$, that is,$\U - \B(x,\varepsilon) \neq \varnothing$. Then,there exists a smooth real function $\lambda$ equal to $1$ on the ball of radius $\varepsilon/2$ centered at $x$, and equal to zero, outside $\B(x,\varepsilon)$. The smooth $p$-form $\bar a : x \mapsto \lambda(x) \, a$ satisfies $\bar a(x) = a$ and vanishes outside $\B(x,\varepsilon)$. For the second question, Let $\cO = \F(\U)$,since $\F$ is a local diffeomorphism, $\cO$ is D-open and$\F_*(\bar a) = (\F^{-1})^*(\bar a)$ is a $p$-form on $\cO$, vanishing outside the D-open subset $\F(\B(x,\varepsilon))$. Since differential forms are local\art{Differential-forms-are-local}, $\F_*(\bar a)$ can be extended by a differential $p$-form $\alpha$ on $\M$ such that $\alpha \restriction (\M - \cO) = 0$.Now, since $\F$ is a local diffeomorphism, and thanks to \exref{The-k-forms-bundle-on-a-real-domain}, the value of $\alpha$ at the point $m$ is characterized by the value of $\bar a $ at $x$, that is, $a$.More precisely $\alpha_m = \F_*(\bar a_x)$, that is, with our identification,$\alpha_m = \F_*(a)$, where $\F_*$ is defined in \art{Pointwise-pullback-or-pushforward-of-forms}.Therefore, $\Forms^p_m(\M) \simeq \Lambda^p(\RR^n)$.That answers the third question. For the fourth question, we just built the map$\cF$, from $\U \times \Lambda^p(\RR^n)$ to $\Forms^p(\M)$, defined by $\cF(x,a) = (\F(x),\F_*(a))$. By construction, $\cF$ is bijective. Let us check rapidly that $\cF$ is a local diffeomorphism. Let $x_0 \in \U$,there exists an open ball $\B_0$ centered at $x_0$ and $\varepsilon > 0$ such that,for all $x \in \B_0$, $\B(x,\varepsilon)$ is strictly included in $\U$. Then, by the previous construction,we get for each $(x,a) \in \B_0 \times \Lambda^p(\RR^n)$ a smooth $p$-form $\bar a$such that $\bar a_x = a$. Moreover, we can choose for each $x \in \B_0$ the bump-function $\lambda$ depending smoothly on $x$, thus the map $(x,a) \mapsto (x,\bar a)$ is smooth. Hence, $\cF \restriction \B_0$ is smooth,therefore $\cF$. Conversely, a smooth parametrization $r \mapsto (m_r,\alpha_r)$ in $\Forms^p(\M)$ can be locally lifted by a smooth parametrization $r \mapsto (m_r,\A(r))$ in $\M \times \Omega^p(\M)$, that is, $\alpha_r = \A(r)_{m_r}$.Then, by pullback, we get a smooth parametrization $r \mapsto (\F^{-1}(m_r), \F^*(\A(r)))$ in $\U \times \Omega^p(\U)$ such that$\cF^{-1}(m_r,\alpha_r) = (x_r = \F^{-1}(m_r), [\F^*(\A(r))]_{x_r})$. Therefore,$\cF^{-1}$ is smooth and $\cF$ is a local diffeomorphism. When $\F$ runs over an atlas of $\M$ the charts $\cF$ run obviously over an atlas of $\Forms^p(\M)$. Finally, $\Forms^p(\M)$ is a manifold, and $\dim(\Forms^p(\M)) = \dim(\M) + \dim(\Lambda^p(\RR^n)) =\dim(\M) + \Cnp$. Note that also shows that $\Forms^p(\M)$ is a locally trivial bundleover $\M$ \art{Fibrations-and-local-triviality-along-the-plots}.\endsolexref\solexref{Smooth-forms-on-diffeological-vector-spaces}(Smooth forms on diffeological vector spaces)1) Let $\alpha \in \DForms^1(\cO)$, let us show that $\A(x): u \mapsto \alpha(t \mapsto x + tu)_0(1)$ is linear.Let $u,v \in \E$, $\A(x)(u + v) = \alpha(t \mapsto x + tu + tv)_0(1)$. Let $\phi : (t,s) \mapsto x + tu + sv$ and $\Delta : t \mapsto (t,t)$. Then,$\alpha(t \mapsto x + tu + tv)_0(1) = \alpha(\phi \circ \Delta)_0(1) =\Delta^*(\alpha(\phi))_0(1) = \alpha(\phi)_{(0,0)}(1,1) = \alpha(\phi)_{(0,0)}(1,0) + \alpha(\phi)_{(0,0)}(0,1)$. Now, let $j_1 : t \mapsto (t,0)$ and $j_2 : s \mapsto (0,s)$, then$\alpha(\phi)_{(0,0)}(1,0) = j_1^*(\alpha(\phi))_0(1) = \alpha(\phi \circ j_1)_0(1)= \alpha(t \mapsto x + tu)_0(1) = \A(x)(u)$ and $\alpha(\phi)_{(0,0)}(0,1) = j_2^*(\alpha(\phi))_0(1) = \alpha(\phi \circ j_2)_0(1)= \alpha(s \mapsto x + sv)_0(1) = \A(x)(v)$. Thus, $\A(x)(u+v) = \A(x)(u) + \A(x)(v)$.Next, let $\lambda \in \RR$, $\A(x)(\lambda u) = \alpha(t \mapsto x + t\lambda u)_0(1)= \alpha(t \mapsto s = t \lambda \mapsto x + s u)_0(1) = \alpha(s \mapsto x + su)_0(\lambda) = \lambda \alpha(s \mapsto x + su)_0(1)= \lambda \A(x)(u)$. Therefore, $\A(x)$ is linear, that is, $\A(x) \in \E^*$. Let us show that $\A(x) \in \E^*_\infty$, that is, for every $n$-plot $\Q : \V \to \E$,$\A(x) \circ \Q \in \Cinfty(\V,\RR)$. Let $\T_x : u \mapsto u + x$, $\T_x$ is a diffeomorphism of $\E$, then $\A(x)(\Q(s)) = \alpha (t \mapsto x + t \Q(s))_0(1)= \T_x^*(\alpha)(t \mapsto t\Q(s))_0(1)$. But $(t,s) \mapsto t\Q(s)$ is a plot of $\E$,and $\T_x^*(\alpha)$ is a differential $1$-form on $\E$, thus $\T_x^*(\alpha)((t,s) \mapsto t\Q(s))$ is a smooth $1$-form on $\cI \times \V$, where $\cI$ is a small interval around $0 \in \RR$. Hence,the map $(t,s) \mapsto \T_x^*(\alpha)((t,s) \mapsto t\Q(s))_{(t,s)}$ is a smooth parametrization in $\Form^1(\RR^{1+n})$, and $s \mapsto \T_x^*(\alpha)(t \mapsto t\Q(s))_0(1) = \T_x^*(\alpha)((t,s) \mapsto t \Q(s))_{(0,s)}(1,0)$ is smooth. Let us show now that $\A \in \Cinfty(\cO,\E^*_\infty)$. Let $\P : \U \to \cO$ be a plot, $\A$ issmooth if for every plot $\Q : \V \to \E$ the parametrization$(r,s) \mapsto \A(\P(r))(\Q(s)) = \alpha(t \mapsto \P(r) + t\Q(s))_0(1)$ is smooth. But $(r,s,t) \mapsto \P(r) + t\Q(s)$ is a plot of $\E$, we are in a situation analogous to the previous one and thus $\A$ is smooth.  \Question{2)} Conversely, let $\A \in \Cinfty(\cO,\E^*_\infty)$ and $\alpha(\P)_r = d[\A(x) \circ \P]_r$, with $x = \P(r)$, that is, $\alpha(\P)_r = d[s \mapsto \A(\P(r)) \circ \P(s)]_{s=r}$. Note first that, since $\A(\P(r)) \circ \P$ is a real function defined on $\U$, $d[s \mapsto \A(\P(r)) \circ \P(s)]_{s=r}$ is a smooth $1$-form on $\U$. Next, let $\F : \V \to \U$ be a smooth parametrization, let $t \in \V$ and $r = f(t)$. On the one hand,$\alpha(\P \circ \F)_t =  d[s \mapsto \A(\P \circ \F(t)) \circ \P \circ \F(s)]_{s=t}= \D(\A(\P(\F(t))) \circ \P \circ \F)(s=t)$,and on the other hand,$\F^*(\alpha(\P))_t =  \alpha(\P)_{r = \F(t)} \circ \D(\F)(t)= d[s \mapsto \A(\P(r)) \circ \P(s)]_{s = r = \F(t)} \circ \D(\F)(t)= \D(\A(\P(\F(t))) \circ \P)(r = \F(t)) \circ \D(\F)(t)$, but$\D(\A(\P(\F(t))) \circ \P \circ \F)(s=t) = \D(\A(\P(\F(t))) \circ \P)(r = \F(t)) \circ \D(\F)(t)$,by the chain rule. Thus, $\alpha(\P \circ \F)_t = \F^*(\alpha(\P))_t$. Therefore, $\alpha$ is a differential $1$-form on $\cO$. \Question{3)} Let us check now that $\sigma \circ \pi = \id$. Let $\sigma(\A) = \alpha$ and $\pi(\alpha) = \A'$,then $\A'(x)(u) = \alpha(t \mapsto \P(t) = x + tu)_{t=0}(1) = \D(t \mapsto \A(\P(0))\circ \P(t))_{t=0}(1) = \D[t \mapsto \A(x)(x+tu) = \A(x)(x) + t \A(x)(u)]_{t=0}(1) = \A(x)(u)$, thus $\A' = \A$.\Question{4)} Remark that $\pi$ is linear and let $\alpha \in \ker(\pi)$, that is, $\alpha(t \mapsto x + tu)_0(1) = 0$, for all $x\in \cO$ and all $u \in \E$. We knowthat the value of a $1$-form is given by its values on the $1$-plots \art{The-k-forms-are-defined-by-the-k-plots}, that is, if $\alpha(c) = 0$,for all $1$-plots $c$ of $\E$, then $\alpha = 0$. %Now, let $c$ be defined on an interval around $t_0 \in \RR$, let $x_0 = c(t_0)$.Decompose $c$ into $t \mapsto s = t-t_0 \mapsto \bar c(s) = c(s + t_0) - x_0\mapsto \bar c(s) + x_0$, that is, $c = \T_{x_0} \circ \bar c \circ \T_{-t_0}$.Then, $\alpha(c)_{t_0}(1) = \alpha(\T_{x_0} \circ \bar c \circ \T_{-t_0})_{t_0}(1)= \T_{x_0}^*(\alpha)(\bar c)_0(1)$. But, by hypothesis, there exists $u \in \E$ such that $\T_{x_0}^*(\alpha)(\bar c)_0(1) = \T_{x_0}^*(\alpha)(t \mapsto tu)_0(1)$, Then, since $\alpha \in \ker(\pi)$, $\alpha(c)_{t_0}(1) =\alpha(t \mapsto x_0 + tu)_0(1) = 0$, thus $\alpha = 0$. Therefore, $\pi$ is injective and surjective, since $\pi \circ \sigma = \id$, that is, a linear isomorphism.\endsolexref\solexref{Forms-bundles-of-irrational-tori} (Forms bundles of irrational tori)Let $\alpha$ be a $p$-form on $\T_\Gamma$. Let $a =  \pi^*(\alpha)$. Thus, for each $\gamma \in \Gamma$,$\gamma^*(a) = \gamma^*(\pi^*(\alpha)) = (\pi \circ  \gamma)^*(\alpha) = \pi^*(\alpha) = a$. Hence, $a$ isinvariant under the translations $\gamma \in \Gamma$.Now, let us decompose the form $a$ of $\RR^n$ in the canonicalbasis of $\Form^p(\RR^n)$\art{Exterior-monomials-and-basis-of-Lambda-p-E},$$  a(x) = \sum_{ij\ldots k}  a_{ij\ldots k}(x) \ \ee^i \wedge \ee^j \wedge \ldots \wedge  \ee^k,   $$where $x \in \RR^n$ and the $a_{ij\ldots k}$ are smooth real functions.Since the monomials $\ee^i \wedge \ee^j \wedge \ldots \wedge  \ee^k$ are invariant by translation, we get$$  \gamma^*(a) = a \quad \Rightarrow \quad a_{ij\ldots  k}(x+\gamma) = a_{ij\ldots k}(x),  $$for all families of indices $ij \ldots k$. Butsince $\Gamma$ is a dense subgroup of $\RR^n$, and the$a_{ij \ldots k}$ are smooth, they are constant.Therefore, $a$ is a constant $p$-form of $\RR^n$. %Now, let $a \in \Form^p(\RR^n)$, and let us show thatthere exists $\alpha$, $p$-form of $\T_\Gamma$, suchthat $a = \pi^*(\alpha)$. We shall apply the criterion\art{Pushing-forms-onto-quotients}. Let $\P$ and$\P'$ be two plots of $\RR^n$, defined on the same domain $\U$, suchthat $\pi \circ \P = \pi \circ \P'$. Thus, for every $r  \in \U$, $\P'(r) - \P(r) \in \Gamma$. But theparametrization $\P' - \P$ is smooth, hence locallyconstant, since $\Gamma$ is discrete. Thus, restricting$\P$ and $\P'$ to connected parts of $\U$, thedifference $\P'-\P$ is constant, that is, $\P'(r) = \P(r) +  \gamma$. Thus, $\P'^*(a) = \P^*(a)$ on the whole $\U$.The criterion is satisfied and there exists $\alpha \in  \DForms^p(\T_\Gamma)$ such that $a = \pi^*(\alpha)$. Conversely, the map $a \mapsto \alpha$ is injective, indeed,thanks to \art{Vanishing-forms-on-quotients}, if$\pi^*(\alpha) = 0$, then $\alpha = 0$.Therefore, the map $a \mapsto \alpha$, defined on$\Form^p(\RR^n)$ to $\DForms^p(\T_\Gamma)$ is anisomorphism.%Next, let usconsider ${\T}_{\Gamma} \times  \DForms^p({\T}_{\Gamma})\simeq {\T}_{\Gamma} \times  \Form^p(\RR^n)$. {\A} pair $(\tau,\alpha)$ is equivalentto $(\tau',\alpha')$ if and only if $\tau = \tau'$ and$\alpha_\tau = \alpha'_{\tau'}$. But $\alpha_\tau =  \alpha'_{\tau'}$ implies $a = a'$, where $a =    \pi_\Gamma^*(\alpha)$ and $a' = \pi_\Gamma^*(\alpha')$.Hence,$$ \Forms^p({\T}_{\Gamma}) \simeq {\T}_{\Gamma}  \times \Form^p(\RR^n).  $$   \Note~We can check that a smoothsection $\tau \mapsto (\tau,a)$ of$\Forms^p({\T}_{\Gamma})$ is just a smooth map$\tau \mapsto a$, and since$\Cinfty({\T}_{\Gamma},\Form^p(\RR^n))\simeq  \Form^p(\RR^n)$ are just the constant maps, then every smooth $p$-form on ${\T}_{\Gamma}$ is\guillemots{constant}. %Now, we can look at the Liouville form on $\Forms^p({\T}_{\Gamma})$.But, rather than looking at $\Liouv$, let us consider its pullback$\pi_\Gamma^*(\Liouv)$ on $\RR^n\times \Form^p(\RR^n)$. Let${\Q} \times \A$ be a plot of $\RR^n\times \Form^p(\RR^n)$, it is just apair of smooth parametrizations defined on some domain $\U$. Then, let$r \in {\U}$ and $\delta r = (\delta_1 r)\cdots (\delta_p r)$ be a$p$-vector of $\RR^n$,\begin{eqnarray*}\pi_\Gamma^*(\Liouv)({\Q} \times {\A})(r)(\delta r) & = & {\A}(r)({\Q})(r)(\delta r) \\ & = &  \sum_{i<j<\ldots< k} {\A}(r)_{ij\ldots k}(\delta_i q) (\delta_j q)\cdots(\delta_k q),\end{eqnarray*}where the $\delta_i q = {\D}({\Q})(r)(\delta_i r)$ are again vectors of $\RR^n$. \endsolexref\solexref{Vectors-bundles-of-irrational-tori}(Vectors bundles of irrational tori) Let ${\T}_{\Gamma}$ be the irrational torus$\RR^n/\Gamma$ where $\Gamma$ is a dense generatingsubgroup of $\RR^n$ and $\Forms^p({\T}_{\Gamma}) \simeq  {\T}_{\Gamma} \times \Form^p(\RR^n)$,\exref{Forms-bundles-of-irrational-tori}. Let $\Q$ be aglobal $p$-plot of $\T_\Gamma$. There exist a smallball $\B$, centered at $0 \in \RR^p$, and a lifting$\tilde \Q : \B \to \RR^n$, such that $\pi \circ \tilde  \Q = \Q \restriction \B$. For the same reason developed in the proof of\exref{Forms-bundles-of-irrational-tori}, two suchliftings differ from a constant element of $\Gamma$. Now,let $\alpha \in \DForms^p(\T_\Gamma)$, and let $a \in  \Form^p(\RR^n)$ be the unique $p$-form such that $a =    \pi^*(\alpha)$ (see\exref{Forms-bundles-of-irrational-tori}). We have,$\alpha(\Q)(0) = \alpha(\pi \circ \tilde \Q)(0) =  \pi^*(\alpha)(\tilde \Q)(0) = a(\tilde \Q)(0) =  a(q_1,\ldots,q_p)$, where $q_i = \D(\tilde    \Q)(0)(\ee_i) \in \RR^n$, $i = 1 \cdots p$. A translationof $\tilde \Q$ by a constant element $\gamma \in \Gamma$does not change the $q_i$. Hence, $\alpha(\Q)(0) =  \alpha(\Q')(0)$ if and only if $q_i = q'_i$ for all $i =    1 \cdots p$. On the other hand, for any $p$ vectors$(v_1, \ldots, v_p) \in (\RR^n)^p$, there exists a$p$-plot $\Q = (t_1,\ldots,t_p) \mapsto \pi(\sum_{i=1}^p  t_i v_i)$ such that $q_i = v_i$. Hence, the map  $\jj_p$ from $\DPaths{p}(\T_\Gamma)$ to $\T_\Gamma  \times \DLin(\DForms^p(\T_\Gamma),\RR) = \T_\Gamma  \times \Lin(\Form^p(\RR^n),\RR)$ is given by: $$ \jj_p: {\Q} \mapsto ({\Q}(0), [a \mapsto  a(q_1,\ldots,q_p)]). $$  But the map$[a \mapsto a(q_1,\ldots,q_p)]$ is just an element of thedual of $\Form^p(\RR^n)$. Then, since each element of thedual $\Form^p(\RR^n)^*$ can be associated with a global$p$-plot,$$  \Tgt{p}{}{{\T}_{\Gamma}} \simeq {\T}_{\Gamma} \times  [\Form^p(\RR^n)]^* \simeq {\T}_{\Gamma} \times  \RR^{n!/p!(n-p)!}.$$ In particular,$$  \Tangent{x}{{\T}_{\Gamma}} \simeq \RR^n \qmbox{and}  \T(\T_\Gamma) \simeq {\T}_{\Gamma}\times\RR^n.  $$ \Note~If we had tested thepaths on differential of function, which is one of theusual way in classical differential geometry ofmanifolds, we should have get $\Tangent{x}{{\T}_{\Gamma}} =  \{0\}$, since the only real functions defined on${\T}_{\Gamma}$ are constant. And this is clearlyunsatisfactory. Thus, the definition suggested in\art{The-p-vectors-bundle-of-diffeological-spaces} is,for diffeological spaces at least, better. However, note that a section of the tangent bundle is necessarilyconstant $x \mapsto (x,v)$, with $v \in \RR^n$, which isnot really surprising.  \endsolexref\solexref{Differential-1-forms-on-pm-1}(Differential $1$-forms on $\RR/\{\pm 1\}$) Let us check that the $1$-form $d[t^2] = 2t \times dt$ passes to the quotient $\Delta$. We apply the criterion \art{Pushing-forms-onto-quotients}. Let $\P$ and $\P'$be two plots such that $\sq \circ \P = \sq \circ \P'$, that is, $\P(r)^2 = \P'(r)^2$for all $r \in \Dom(\P) = \Dom(\P')$, then $d[t^2](\P)_r = \D(r \mapsto \P(r)^2)_r = \D(r \mapsto \P'(r)^2)_r = d[t^2](\P')_r$.Thus, there exists a $1$-form $\theta$ on $\Delta$ such that $\sq^*(\theta) = d[t^2]$.Now, let $\alpha$ be a differential $1$-form on $\Delta$, its pullback $\sq^*(\alpha)$ is a differential $1$-form on $\RR$, that is $\sq^*(\alpha) = \F(t) dt$. But $\sq^*(\alpha)$ is invariant by $\{\pm 1\}$, hence$\F(-t) = - \F(t)$, then $\F$ vanishes at $t=0$. Since $\F$ is $\Cinfty$, there exists a smooth function$\varphi$ such that $\F(t) = 2t\varphi(t)$. Thus, $\sq^*(\alpha) = 2t\varphi(t) dt = \varphi(t) d[t^2]$.Now, by invariance, there exists a smooth function$f \in \Cinfty(\Delta,\RR)$ such that $\sq \circ \varphi = f$. Therefore, $\sq^*(\alpha) = \sq^*(f \times \theta)$.By \art{Vanishing-forms-on-quotients}, $\alpha = f \times \theta$. Next, every $1$-plot $\gamma$ of $\Delta$such that $\gamma(0)= 0$ has a local lift $\bar\gamma$ in $\RR$ such that $\bar\gamma(0) = 0$, and then$\alpha(\gamma)_0(1) = \sq^*(\alpha)(\bar\gamma)_0(1) = \varphi(\bar\gamma(0)) \times 2 \bar\gamma(0) \bar\gamma'(0) = 0$,where the prime $'$ denotes the derivative with respect to $t$. Therefore, $\alpha_0 = 0$ and by consequence $\T_0(\Delta) = \{0\}$. \endsolexref%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  Exercises %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\SkipTocEntry\section*{Lie Derivative of Differential Forms}\solexref{Anti-Lie-derivative}(Anti Lie derivative)Let $\P : \U \to \X$ be an $n$-plot, and let us shortly denote $p$ vectors by $[v]=(v_1)\ldots(v_p)$, we have on the one hand$${\partial \over \partial t} \bigg\{\F(t)^*(\F(t)_*(\alpha))(\P)_r[v]\bigg\}_{t=0} = {\partial \over \partial t} \bigg\{\alpha(\P)_r[v]\bigg\}_{t=0} = 0,$$and on the other hand,\begin{eqnarray*}{\partial \over \partial t} \bigg\{\F(t)^*(\F(t)_*(\alpha))(\P)_r[v]\bigg\}_{t=0} & = & \D\left(\vect{t \\ s} \mapsto \F(t)^*(\F(s)_*(\alpha))(\P)_r[v]\right)_{0 \choose 0} \vect{1 \\ 1} \\& = & \D\left(\vect{t \\ s} \mapsto \F(t)^*(\F(s)_*(\alpha))(\P)_r[v]\right)_{0 \choose 0} \vect{1 \\ 0} \\& + & \D\left(\vect{t \\ s} \mapsto \F(t)^*(\F(s)_*(\alpha))(\P)_r[v]\right)_{0 \choose 0} \vect{0 \\ 1} \\& = & \D(t \mapsto \F(t)^*(\alpha)(\P)_r[v])_0(1) \\& + & \D(s \mapsto \F(s)_*(\alpha)(\P)_r[v])_0(1) \\& = & {\partial \over \partial t}\bigg\{ \F(t)^*(\alpha)(\P)_r[v]\bigg\}_{t=0} \\& + & {\partial \over \partial s}\bigg\{ \F(s)_*(\alpha)(\P)_r[v]\bigg\}_{s=0}.\end{eqnarray*}Therefore,$${\partial \over \partial t}\bigg\{ \F(t)_*(\alpha)(\P)_r[v]\bigg\}_{t=0} = - {\partial \over \partial t}\bigg\{ \F(t)^*(\alpha)(\P)_r[v]\bigg\}_{t=0},$$that is,$${\partial \over \partial t}\bigg\{ \F(t)_*(\alpha)\bigg\}_{t=0} = - \DLie_\F(\alpha).$$\endsolexref\solexref{Multi-Lie-derivative}(Multi Lie derivative)First of all, the proof that this generalization of the Liederivative is well defined is a slight adaptation ofthe first proposition of\art{The-Lie-derivative-of-differential-forms}. For the second question, let${\P}: {\U} \to {\X}$ be a plot.

Now let $\ell' \in \Loops(\X,x)$, since $\ell$ and $\ell'$ are always fixed-ends homotopic to two stationary loops(which do not change the integrals), we can assume that $\ell$ and $\ell'$ are stationary.Then,\begin{eqnarray*}\int_{\ell \vee \ell'} \alpha & = & \int_0^1 \alpha(\ell \vee \ell')_t(1) \, dt \\& = & \int_0^{1/2} \alpha(\ell \vee \ell')_t(1) \, dt + \int_{1/2}^1 \alpha(\ell \vee \ell')_t(1) \, dt \\& = & \int_0^{1/2} \alpha(t \mapsto \ell(2t))_t(1) \, dt + \int_{1/2}^1 \alpha(t \mapsto \ell'(2t-1))_t(1) \, dt \\& = & \int_0^1 \alpha(t \mapsto \ell(t))_t(1) \, dt + \int_{0}^1 \alpha(t \mapsto \ell'(t))_t(1) \, dt \\& = & \int_\ell \alpha + \int_{\ell'} \alpha.\end{eqnarray*}Thus, $\class(\ell) \mapsto \int_\ell \alpha$ is a homomorphism from $\pi_1(\X,x)$ to $\RR$ and $\Periods_\alpha$ is the image of this homomorphism.Now, let $x' \in \X$, since $\X$ is connected, there exists a stationary path $c$ connecting $x$ to $x'$, and clearly $\int_{c \vee \ell \vee \bar c} \alpha = \int_c \alpha + \int_\ell \alpha - \int_c \alpha = \int_\ell \alpha$,where $\ell \in \Loops(\X,x')$ and $\bar c(t) = 1-t$ is the reverse of $c$.

Let $a =  \pi_\Gamma^*(\alpha)$ be the pullback of $\alpha$ by theprojection $\pi_\Gamma: \RR^n \to {\T}_{\Gamma}$. By construction, the $p$-form $a$ is invariant by theaction of $\Gamma$, that is, for all $\gamma \in \Gamma$,$\gamma^*(a) = a$, where $\gamma(x) = x+\gamma$, $x \in  \RR^n$. But the invariance of $a$ under $\Gamma$ andthe density of $\Gamma$ in $\RR^n$ imply that everycomponent $a_{i\ldots k}$ of $a$ is constant. Hence $a  \in \Lambda^p(\RR^n)$ and therefore,   $ \Omega^p({\T}_{\Gamma}) \simeq \Lambda^p(\RR^n)$. Now,since the components of any $a = \pi_\Gamma^*(\alpha)$are constant, the form $a$ is closed, $da = 0$. But,since $\pi_\Gamma$ is a subduction\art{Pushing-forms-onto-quotients}, $da = 0$ and $da =  \pi_\Gamma^*(d\alpha)$ imply $d\alpha = 0$.

Now, if $\alpha = d\beta$,$\beta \in \Omega^{p-1}({\T}_{\Gamma},\RR)$, then $\alpha = 0$ since$d\beta = 0$ for any form on ${\T}_{\Gamma}$.

Let $\F : \V \to \U$ be a smooth $m$-parametrization, we have$$\alpha(\P \circ \F)_s(\delta s)= \int_0^{2\pi} \bigg\langle \J    \{[\P(\F(s))](\X(\theta))\} , {\partial [\P(\F(s))](\X(\theta)) \over    \partial s}(\delta s) \bigg\rangle \ d\theta.$$Let $r = \F(s)$, then$$ \alpha(\P \circ \F)_s(\delta s) = \int_0^{2\pi} \bigg\langle \J    [\P(r)(\X(\theta))] , {\partial \P(r)(\X(\theta)) \over    \partial r}{\partial r \over \partial s}(\delta s) \bigg\rangle \ d\theta,$$where $\partial r/\partial s = \D(\F)(s)$. Thus, $$ \alpha(\P \circ \F)_s(\delta s) = \alpha(\P)_{\F(s)}(\D(\F)(s))(\delta s) = \F^*(\alpha(\P))_s(\delta s).$$Therefore, $\alpha$ is a $1$-form on $\Diff(\S^1)$. Now, let us consider the canonical $1$-form $\Theta$ on $\S^1$ defined by$$ \Theta(\Q)_s(\delta s) = \bigg\langle \J    [\Q(s)] , {\partial \Q(s) \over \partial s}(\delta s) \bigg\rangle,$$where $\Q$ is a plot of $\S^1$, with the same kind of notation as above.Next, let $z \in \S^1$ and $\eR(z) : \Diff(\S^1) \to \S^1$ be the orbit map, $\eR(z)(\varphi) = \varphi(z)$.The pullback of $\Theta$ by $\eR(z)$ is then given, on the plot $\P$, by$$ [\eR(z)^*(\Theta)](\P)_r(\delta r) = \bigg\langle \J    [\P(r)(z)] , {\partial \P(r)(z) \over \partial r}(\delta r) \bigg\rangle,$$and then$$ \alpha(\P)_r(\delta r) = \int_0^{2\pi} [\eR(\X(\theta))^*(\Theta)](\P)_r(\delta r) \, d\theta.$$Thus, by additivity of the integral and since $d\Theta = 0$, $d\alpha = 0$. Note that this last expression of $\alpha$ proves directly that $\alpha$ is a $1$-form on $\Diff(\S^1)$. Next, to compute $\int_\sigma \alpha$, we need $$\sigma(t)(\X(\theta)) = \begin{pmatrix}\cos(2\pi t) & \sin(2\pi t) \\ -\sin(2\pi t) & \cos(2\pi t)\end{pmatrix}    \vect{\cos(\theta) \\ \sin(\theta)} = \vect{\cos(2\pi t + \theta) \\ \sin(2\pi t + \theta)}.$$Then,\begin{eqnarray*} \int_\sigma \alpha & = & \int_0^1 \alpha(\sigma)_t(1) \, dt \\ & = & \int_0^1 dt \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta \ \bigg\langle \J    \vect{\cos(2 \pi t + \theta) \\ \sin(2 \pi t + \theta)} , {\partial \over \partial t}     \vect{\cos(2 \pi t + \theta) \\ \sin(2 \pi t + \theta)} \bigg\rangle \\    & = & 2 \pi \int_0^1 dt \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta  \\    & = & 4 \pi^2.\end{eqnarray*}Therefore, the identity component of $\Diff(\S^1)$ is not simply connected,see \exref{Closed-1-forms-on-simply-connected-spaces}. Actually, it was not necessaryto integrate the pullback $\eR(z)^*(\Theta)$ on the loop $\X$, we couldhave considered just the pullback $\eR(\ee_1)^*(\Theta)$.\endsolexref%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  Exercises %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\SkipTocEntry\section*{Homotopy and Differential Forms, Poincar\'e Lemma}\solexref{The-Fubini-Study-form-is-locally-exact} (The Fubini-Study form is locally exact) We know that the infinite projective space $\cP_\CC$ is a diffeological manifoldmodeled on the Hilbert space $\cH_\CC$\art{The-infinite-complex-projective-space}.

Then, thanks to \art{Homotopic-invariance-of-the-De-Rham-cohomology}, they induce the same map in cohomology, ${\hat x_0^*}{}_{\rm dR} =  {\hat x_1^*}{}_{\rm dR}$. Next, let us consider $\X = \S^1 \subset \RR^2$. Note first that $\S^1$ is connected  and $\HDR^p(\S^1) = \{0\}$ for all $p \geq 1$, then themorphism from $\HDR^p(\S^1)$ to $\HDR^p(\Diff(\S^1))$ is unique and obviously injective for $p = 0$ and $p \geq 1$.Let $\hat \ee_1 : \Diff(\S^1) \to \S^1$ be the orbit map of the point $\ee_1 = (1,0)$.Let $\alpha$ be a closed $1$-form on $\S^1$ such that ${\hat\ee}_1^*{}_{\rm dR}(\class(\alpha)) = 0$, that is, $\hat\ee_1^*(\alpha) = d\F$, where$\F \in \Cinfty(\Diff(\S^1),\RR)$. Now, since $\alpha$ is closed, the integral $\int_\ell\alpha$, where $\ell \in \Loops(\S^1,\ee_1)$, depends only on the homotopy classof $\ell$, \exref{Closed-1-forms-on-connected-spaces},and thanks to \exref{Covering-tori}, we know that there exists $k \in \ZZ$ such that $\ell \sim [t \mapsto \cR(2\pi k t)(\ee_1)]$, where $\cR(\theta)$ is the rotation of angle $\theta$. Let $\sigma_k(t) = \cR(2\pi k t)$, then $\sigma_k$ belongs to $\Loops(\Diff(\S^1),\id_{\S^1})$, and $\ell \sim [t \mapsto \sigma_k(t)(\ee_1)]$. Thus,on the one hand, $\int_{\sigma_k} d\F = 0$, and on the other hand,$\int_{\sigma_k} d\F = \int_{\sigma_k} \hat\ee_1^*(\alpha) = \int_{\hat \ee_1 \circ \sigma_k} \alpha = \int_{[t \mapsto \sigma_k(t)(\ee_1)]} \alpha =\int_\ell \alpha$.

Compared with \exref{Is-the-group-Diff-S-1-simply-connected}, this also shows that the identity component of $\Diff(\S^1)$ is not simply connected. This example is a particular case where a smooth map $f : \X \to \X'$ induces a surjection from $\pi_1(\X,x)$ onto $\pi_1(\X',x')$, where $x' = f(x)$. We assume $\X$ and $\X'$ connected. In this situation, for all $\alpha \in \Omega^1(\X)$ such that $d\alpha = 0$, if $f^*(\alpha)$ is exact, that is, if $\int_{\ell'} f^*(\alpha) = 0$ for all $\ell' \in \Loops(\X',x')$, then $\int_\ell \alpha = 0$ for all $\ell \in \Loops(\X,x)$, and thus $\alpha$ is exact.

And, since $\K$ is agroup for the addition, $t = (\N+1) x$ belongs to $\K$.Therefore, in this case $\K$ is not a strict subgroup of$\RR$.%Thus, we are in the second case. Let $\P : \U \to \K$ be aplot, that is $\P \in \Cinfty(\U, \RR)$ and $\P(\U)  \subset \K$. Let us assume that $0 \in \U$ and that $\P(0)    = 0$. If it is not the case we can compose $\P$ at thesource and the target such that it will be the case.Since $\U$ is open, there exists $\R > 0$ such that forevery $\rho < \R$ the open balls $\B(\rho)$ of radius $\rho$,centered at $0 \in \U$,  are contained in$\U$. Then, for every $0 < \rho < \R$ let us choose $r \in  \B(\rho)$ and let $k = \P(r)$. Thus, $k \in \K$, butalso all the $\P(sr)$, $0 \leq s \leq 1$, are elementsof $\K$. Since $p : s \mapsto \P(sr)$ is smooth,therefore continuous, $p$ takes all the values between $0  = p(0)$ and $k = p(1)$. But by hypothesis 2) this is notpossible except if $p$ is constant and $k = 0$.Therefore, $\P$ is locally constant and the group $\K$is discrete.Next, let $\K$ be a strict subgroup of $\RR$, $\K$ is discrete and thereforeits D-topology also is discrete \art{D-topology-on-discrete-and-coarse-diffeological-spaces}.There are two cases: either $\K$ is generated by one number $a$, $\K = a \ZZ$, or there exist twonumbers $a \neq 0$ and $b \neq 0$, independent over $\QQ$, such that $\{n a\}_{n \in \ZZ} \subset \K$,$\{m b\}_{m \in \ZZ} \subset \K$, and $\{n a\}_{n \in \ZZ} \cap \{m b\}_{m \in \ZZ} = \{0\}$.In the first case, the group is embedded in $\RR$. Indeed, any subset $\A$ of a discrete space is a D-open, if $\K = a \ZZ$ then one can find an open interval $\I_x$ centeredaround each point $x$ of $\A$ such that $\I_x \cap \K = \{x\}$, and the intersection of this union of intervals with $\A$ is just $\A$. In the second case,$\K$ contains the dense subgroup $a \times [\ZZ + \alpha \ZZ]$, with $\alpha = b/a \in \RR-\QQ$. Then, the intersection of every open intervall of $\RR$ with $\KK$ contains an infinite number of pointsof $\KK$. Therefore, $\KK$ is not embedded in $\RR$.\endsolexref\solexref{Diagonal-diffeomorphisms}(Diagonal diffeomorphisms)A plot of $\Delta(\Diff(\X)) \subset \Diff(\X^\N)$ writes, in a unique way,$r \mapsto \Delta(\varphi_r)$, where $r \mapsto \varphi_r$ is some parametrization in $\Diff(\X)$.

Sincethe projection $\pr_k : (x_1,\ldots,x_\N) \mapsto x_k$ is a subduction, that is equivalent to $(r,x_k) \mapsto \varphi_r(x_k)$ being smooth, which means then that $r \mapsto \varphi_r$ is a plot of $\Diff(\X)$.

If $\Z$ and $\Z'$are collinear, then there exists $\tau \in \S^1 \simeq \UU(\CC)$ such that $\Z' = \tau \Z$,  and the map $\Z \mapsto \tau \Z$ belongs to $\UU(\cH)$. Otherwise, let $\E$ be the plane spannedby these two vectors and let $\F$ be its orthogonal for theHermitian product. According to Bourbaki \cite{Bou55}, $\E$ and $\F$ are supplementary $\cH = \E \oplus \F$. The vectors $\Z$ and $\Z'$ are vectors ofthe unit sphere $\S^3 \subset \E \simeq \CC^2$, now thegroup $\UU(\CC^2)$ acts transitively on $\S^3$, thereexists $\A \in \UU(\CC^3)$ such that $\Z' = \A \Z$. Thismap, extended to $\cH$ by the identity on $\F$, belongs to$\UU(\cH)$ and maps $\Z$ to $\Z'$. Therefore, the actionof $\UU(\cH)$ is transitive on $\cS_\CC$, which isequivalent to the assertion that $\pi$ is surjective. \alinea{2.} {\em The map $\pi$ is a subduction} --- Let $\Q:\U\to \cS_\CC$ be a plot. Wewant to lift locally $\Q$ along the projection $\pi$,that is, for any $r_0 \in \U$, to find a plot $\P:\V\to \UU(\cH)$, defined on some open neighborhood $\V$ of $r_0$, suchthat $\P(r)(\ee_1) = \Q(r)$, for all $r \in \V$. So, let$r_0 \in \U$, let $\V$ be an open neighborhood of $r_0$, let$j:\CC^m\to \cH$ be an injection, and let$\phi:\V\to \CC^m$ be a smooth parametrization such that $\Q \restriction \V = j\circ \phi$. Let us denote $\E = j(\CC^m)$. The plot $\Q$ of $\cS_\CC$ takes its values in$\E$, and hence in the unit sphere of $\E$:$\S(\E) = \E\cap \cS_\CC$. Thediffeology induced on $\S(\E)$ is the standarddiffeology: $\S(\E)\simeq \S^{2m-1}$. Thus, $\Q \restriction \V$ is an ordinary smooth map from$\V$ into $\S(\E)$. But we know that the projection from$\UU(m)$ onto $\S(\CC^m)$ is a submersion, {\em a fortiori\/} asubduction. Thus, for any $r_0 \in \V$ there exist a domain$\W \subset \V$ and a smooth lifting $\varphi : \W\to \UU(m)$ such that $\Q(r) = \varphi(r)(\ee_1^m)$, for all$r \in \W$, where $\ee_1^m$ is the vector $(1,0,\ldots,0) \in \CC^m$. Let us assume that $\ee_1 = j(\ee_1^m)$, if itis not the case we conjugate everything with some suitable linear map. Now, let $\F$ be the orthogonal of$\E$. The space $\cH$ is the direct sum of $\E$ and $\F$,\ie, $\cH = \E\oplus \F$. Every vector$\Z \in \cH$ has a unique decomposition $\Z = \Z_\E+ \Z_\F$ such that $\Z_\E \in \E$ and $\Z_\F \in \F$. Let then $$ \P(r)(\Z) = \varphi(r)(\Z_\E) + \Z_\F, $$ for all $r \in \W$ and all $\Z \in \cH$. For all $r \in \W$, the map $\P(r)$ is smooth because the decomposition $\Z \mapsto (\Z_\E, \Z_\F)$ is linear, and then smooth for thefine diffeology. Moreover $\P(r)$ clearly preserves theHermitian product, and is obviously invertible. The map$\P$ lifts $\Q$ locally, $$  \P(r)(\ee_1) = \varphi(r)(\ee_1^m) + 0 = \Q(r), $$for all $r \in \W$. It remains then to check that $\P$ is a plot of the functionaldiffeology of $\UU(\cH)$. But this is quite clear, afinite family of vectors decomposes into components belonging to $\E$ and to $\F$, and because the family is finite one has only a finiteintersection of open sets which is open, we get so the property we are looking for. The inverse of $\P(r)$ does not givemore problems.

Let $\KK$ be the groupoid associated with$\pi$. Since $\pi$ is injective,$\X_q = \pi^{-1}(q)$ is equal to the singleton $\{x = \sqrt[3]{q}\}$.Hence, $\Mor(q,q')$ is itself reduced to the singleton $\{[\sqrt[3]{q} \mapsto \sqrt[3]{q'}]\}$.Then, $$\Mor(\KK) = \{ [x \mapsto x'] \mid x,x' \in \RR\},$$ and set theoretically $\Mor(\KK) \simeq \RR \times \RR$. The question is about the diffeology, on $\RR \times \RR$, induced by the diffeology of $\Mor(\KK)$. Let $\P : \U \to \Mor(\KK)$ be a plot, and let$\P(r) = \{[x_r \mapsto x'_r]\}$. Let us explicit the spaces $\X_{\source \circ \P}$ and $\X_{\target \circ \P}$, $$ \X_{\source \circ \P} = \{(r,x_r) \in \U \times \RR \mid r \in \U\} \qmbox{and} \X_{\target \circ \P} = \{(r,x'_r) \in \U \times \RR \mid r \in \U\}.$$The maps $\P_\source$ and $\P_\target$ are then given by$$ \P_\source(r,x_r) = \P(r)(x_r) = x'_r \qmbox{and} \P_\target(r,x'_r) = \P(r)^{-1}(x'_r) = x_r.$$These maps are smooth if and only if the parametrizations $r \mapsto x'_r$ and $r \mapsto x_r$ are smooth, which implies in particular that $\chi \circ \P : r \mapsto (x_r^3,{x'_r}{}^3)$ is smooth. Therefore, the diffeology induced on $\RR \times \RR$ by the groupoid diffeology of $\KK$is the standard diffeology. Note that the injection $i_\Q : \Q \to \Mor(\KK)$ is indeed smooth, even if the presence of the cubic root is disturbing. Let $r \mapsto q_r$ be a plot of $\Q = \RR$, defined on $\U$, and let $\P : r \mapsto \id_{\X_{q_r}}$ bethe composite with $i_\Q$. We have to check that $\P$ is a plot of $\Mor(\KK) \simeq \RR \times \RR$.In this case $\X_{\source \circ \P} = \X_{\target \circ \P} = \{(r,\sqrt[3]{q_r}) \mid r \in \U\}$ and $\P_\source(r,\sqrt[3]{q_r}) = \P_\target(r,\sqrt[3]{q_r}) = \sqrt[3]{q_r}$.A parametrization $s \mapsto (x_{r_s}, \sqrt[3]{q_{r_s}})$ of $\X_{\source \circ \P}$ is a plotif and only if $s \mapsto x_{r_s}$ and $s \mapsto \sqrt[3]{q_{r_s}}$ are smooth, and thus $\P_\source$ and $\P_\target$ are smooth. Eventually, the real question is: is this groupoid fibrating? The answer is No! Because the map $\chi : (x,x') \mapsto (x^3,x'{}^3)$ is not a subduction, and now the reason is exactlybecause $q \mapsto \sqrt[3]{q}$ is not smooth. \endsolexref%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  Exercises %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\SkipTocEntry\section*{Principal and Associated Fiber Bundles}\solexref{Polarized-smooth-functions} (Polarized smooth functions)A line $\DD$ passing through the origin has 2 unit direction vectors$\{\pm u\}$. So, we can equip $\P^1(\RR)$ with the quotient diffeology of $\S^1 \subset \RR^2$ by $\{ \pm 1\}$. This diffeology is equivalent to the powerset diffeology, see \exref{The-powerset-diffeology-of-the-set-of-lines}. Therefore, we can regard $\T$ as$$  \T = \{(\pm u , f) \in \P^1(\RR) \times \Cinfty(\RR^2,\CC)   \mid f(x + su) = f(x), \ \forall x \in \RR^2, \ \forall s \in \RR \}.  $$Now, let us consider the pullback of the projection $\pi : \T \to \P^1(\RR)$by the projection $p : \S^1 \to \P^1(\RR)$, that is, $$  p^*(\T) = \{ (u,f) \in \S^1 \times \Cinfty(\RR^2,\CC) \mid   f(x + su) = f(x) \ \forall x \in \RR^2, \ \forall s \in \RR \}.  $$Thus, $\T$ is now equivalent to the quotient of $p^*(\T)$ by the equivalence relation $(u,f) \sim (\pm u,f)$. Then, let us introduce the $\pi/2$ rotation $\J$ in the plane $\RR^2$, and let us consider the following map$$  \phi : (u,\F) \mapsto (u, f = [x \mapsto \F(u \cdot \J x)]),   \qmbox{for all} (u,\F) \in \S^1 \times \Cinfty(\RR,\CC),  $$where the dot $\cdot$ denotes the usual scalar product. Next, since $u \cdot \J u = 0$, $f(x + su) = \F(u \cdot \J(x +su)) =   \F((u \cdot \J x) + (su \cdot \J u)) = \F(u \cdot \J x) = f(x)$,and $f = [x \mapsto \F(u \cdot \J x)]$ is constant on all the lines parallel to $\RR u$. Moreover, $\phi$ is bijective, for all $u \in \S^1$ and $f \in \Cinfty(\RR,\CC)$ such that $f(x + su) = f(x)$,$$  \phi^{-1}(u,f) = (u, \F = [t \mapsto f(t \times \J^{-1} u)]).    $$The maps $\phi$ and $\phi^{-1}$ are clearly smooth, thus $p^*(\T)$ istrivial, equivalent to $\pr_1 : \S^1 \times \Cinfty(\RR, \CC) \to \S^1$. This is sufficient to prove that $\pi : \T \to \P^1$ is a diffeologicalfiber bundle.Then, the pullback of the action of $\varepsilon \in \{\pm 1\}$, by $\phi$, writes $\varepsilon(u, \F) =   (\varepsilon u, \F \circ \hat \varepsilon)$, where $\hat \varepsilon : t \mapsto \varepsilon \times t$. Hence, $\T$ is equivalent to the quotient of $\S^1 \times \Cinfty(\RR,\CC)$ by this action. Finally, let us consider the induction of $\RR$ into $\Cinfty(\RR,\CC)$ by$t \mapsto [x \mapsto t x]$. The subbundle $\phi(\S^1 \times \RR)/\{\pm1\} \subset \T$ is the quotient of the product $\S^1 \times \RR$ by the action $\varepsilon(u,t)=(\varepsilon u,\varepsilon t)$, $\varepsilon \in \{\pm 1\}$. But this is exactly the M\"obius strip, and the M\"obius strip is not trivial over $\P^1(\RR)$, thus the fiber bundle $\T$ also is not trivial.\endsolexref\solexref{Playing-with-SO(3)} (Playing with $\SO(3)$)Since $\SO(2,\ee_1)$ is a subgroup of $\SO(3)$, the projection $\pi : \SO(3) \to \quotient{\SO(3)}{\SO(2,\ee_1)}$ is a principalfibration, \art{Fibrations-of-groups-by-subgroups}. Now, let us prove thatthe map $p : \SO(3) \to \S^2$, defined by $\A \mapsto \A\ee_1$, is a subduction and then identifies $\quotient{\SO(3)}{\SO(2,\ee_1)}$ with $\S^2$. First of all, the map $p$ is surjective. Indeed, let $u \in \S^2$, there exists a vector $v \in \S^2$ orthogonal to $u$. Then, the matrix $\A = [u\ v\ u \times v]$, where $\times$ denotes the vector product, belongs to $\SO(3)$, and $\A\ee_1 = u$. Now, let $r \mapsto u_r$ be a smooth parametrization of $\S^2$, $r_0$ be a point in its domain, and $u_0 = u_{r_0}$. Let $w \in \RR^3$ such that $[1-u_0 \bar u_0]w \neq 0$,where $[1-u_0 \bar u_0]$ is the orthogonal projector along $u_0$. Since themap $r \mapsto [1-u_r \bar u_r]w$ is smooth, there exists a small open ball $\eB$ centered at $r_0$ such that, for all $r \in \eB$, the vector $w_r = [1-u_r \bar u_r]w$ is not zero. Now, let $v_r = w_r/\norm{w_r}$. Since $w_r$ is not zero, $r \mapsto v_r$ is smooth, it belongs to $\S^2$ and it is orthogonal to $u_r$. Thus, $r \mapsto \A_r = [u_r \ v_r \ u_r \times v_r]$ is a plot of $\SO(3)$such that $\A_r(\ee_1) = u_r$. Therefore $p$ is a subduction. Now we just observe that $p(\A) = p(\A')$ if and only if there exists $k \in \SO(2,\ee_1)$ such that $\A' = \A k^{-1}$. Therefore, thanks to the uniqueness of quotients \art{Uniqueness-of-quotient},we conclude that $p$ is a fibration, and moreover a principal fibration.Finally, the map $(\A,v) \mapsto (\A\ee_1,\A v)$ from $\SO(3) \times \ee_1^\perp$ to $\S^2 \times \RR^3$ takes its values in $\T\S^2$ and represents theassociated fiber bundle $\SO(3) \times_{\SO(2,\ee_1)} \ee_1^\perp$.\endsolexref\solexref{Homogeneity-of-manifolds}(Homogeneity of manifolds)Let $\varepsilon_n$ be a smooth bump-function defined on $\RR^n$, equal to $1$ on the ball $\eB'$ of radius $r/2$, centered at $0_n$, and equal to $0$ outside the ball $\eB$ of radius $r$. Let $\varepsilon$ be a smooth bump-function defined on $\RR$, equal to $1$ on the interval$\closedinterval{-\delta/2,1+\delta/2}$ and equal to $0$ outside the interval$\openinterval{-\delta,1+\delta}$. Let $f$ be the vector field defined on$\RR^n \times \RR$ by $f(x,t)=(0_n,\varepsilon_n(x) \times \varepsilon(t))$.The vector field $f$ is equal to zero outside the cylinder $\eC$ and equal to $(0_n,1)$ into the cylinder$\eC' = \eB' \times \closedinterval{-\delta/2,1+\delta/2}$. Since the support of $f$ is contained in $\eC$, $f$ is integrable, and thetime $1$ of its exponential is a compactly supported diffeomorphism, whose support iscontained in $\eC$. Moreover, since inside $\eC'$ the vector field $f$ isconstant equal to $(0_n,1)$, its exponential is the translation $\exp(sf)(x,t)=(x,t+s)$ as soon as $(x,t)$ and $(x,t+s)$ belong to $\eC'$. Thus $\exp(f)(0_n,0) = (0_n,1)$, and $\exp(f)$ satisfies the conditions of the exercise. Now, let $\F : \cB \to \M$ be some chart of $\M$, where $\cB$ is an open ball. Let $r,r' \in \cB$,let $x = \F(r)$ and $x' = \F(r')$. There exists a small open cylinder$\cC$ containing thesegment $\{r + s(r'-r)\}_{s=0}^1$ and contained in $\cB$. According to the first part of the exercise(modulo smooth equivalence) there exists a diffeomorphism of $\cB$ with compact support contained in $\cC$, and mapping $r$ to $r'$. Thus, the image of this diffeomorphism by the chart $\F$ defines a local diffeomorphism of $\M$, defined on the open subset $\F(\cB)$, mapping $x$ to $x'$ and which is the identity outside a closed subset. It can thus be extended, by the identity, into a global compactly supported diffeomorphism of $\M$, mapping $x$ to $x'$.Next, let us choose $x$ and $x'$, any two points in $\M$. Let us note first thatthere exists an atlas of $\M$ made of charts whose domains are open balls, let us call these charts {\em round charts}.Since $\M$ is connected, there exists a path $\gamma$ connecting $x$ to $x'$, let $\{\F_t\}_{t=0}^1$ be a family of round charts such that $\gamma(t) \in \Val(\F_t)$. The set $\{\gamma^{-1}(\Val(\F_t))\}_{t=0}^1$ is an open covering of $\closedinterval{0,1}$, by compacity, after re-indexation, there exists a finite family $\{\F_i\}_{i=1}^\N$ such that $\{\gamma^{-1}(\Val(\F_i))\}_{i=1}^\N$ is an open covering of $\closedinterval{0,1}$. We can even assume that for every index $i = 1,\ldots, \N$,$\eJ_i = \gamma^{-1}(\Val(\F_i))$ is an open interval of $\RR$ such that only two successive intervals intersect. Chosing a point $t_i \in \eJ_i \cap \eJ_{i+1}$,$i = 1,\ldots, \N - 1$, we get a family of points $x_i = \gamma(t_i)$ such that two consecutive points $(x_i, x_{i+1})$ belong to the values of one round chart $\F_i$.Now, thanks to the previous result we get a finite family of compactly supported diffeomorphisms of $\M$ mapping every point of this familyto its successor, the first point being $x$ and the last $x'$. Thus, after composition we get a compactly supported diffeomorphism mapping $x$ to $x'$. And we conclude that the map $\hat x_0 : \CSDiff(\M) \to \M$ is surjective.Now, to prove that the projection $\hat x_0$ is a principal fibration, withstructure group the stabilizer $\CSDiff(\M,x_0)$,we need to lift locally any plot of $\M$. But since $\M$ is a manifold, it is sufficient to lift locallyany chart $\F : \U \to \M$. Without loss of generality, we can assume that $0 \in \U$, and for simplicity $\U$ connected. Let us prove first that there exists a smoothmap $r \mapsto \Psi_r$, where r belongs to an open ball centered at $0$, contained in $\U$, and $\Psi_r$ is a compactly supported diffeomorphismof $\U$, mapping $0$ to $r$. For that, let us chose two balls $\eB$ and $\eB'$ of radiuses $\R < \R'$, contained in $\U$ and centered at $0$. Let $\lambda$ be a smooth bump-function defined on $\U$, equal to $1$ in $\eB$and equal to $0$ outside $\eB'$. Let  us define $f_r(r') = \lambda(r') \times r$, for $r' \in \U$ and $\vert r \vert < \R$.The map $r \mapsto f_r$ is a smooth family ofvector fields on $\U$, with supports contained in $\eB'$. For all $t$, $r$ and $r'$ such that $r'$ and $r' +tr$ belong to $\eB$,the exponential of $f_r$ coincides with the translation $\exp(t f_r)(r') = r' + tr$. Thus, for $t=1$, $r'=0$, and $\vert r \vert < \R$, we get $\exp(f_r)(0) = r$. Thanks to the differentiability of $r \mapsto f_r$ and to thedifferentiability of the solutions of an ordinary differential equationwith respect to the parameters, the map $r \mapsto \exp(f_r)$ is smoothfor the functional diffeology. Now, since the support of $\exp(f_r)$ is contained in $\U$, $\F \circ \exp(f_r) \circ \F^{-1}$is a local compactly supported diffeomorphism of $\M$ mapping $\F(\U)$ into itself, therefore it can be extended, by the identity, into a global compactly supported diffeomorphism $\Phi_r$ of $\M$, mapping $x'_0 = \F(0)$ to $x = \F(r)$, that is, $\Phi_r(x'_0) = \F(r)$. Next,we know that there exists a diffeomorphism $\varphi$ mapping $x_0$ to$x'_0$, thus the diffeomorphism $\phi_r = \Phi_r \circ \varphi$ maps $x_0$ to $\F(r)$, that is, $\hat x_0(\phi_r) = \phi_r(x_0) = \F(r)$. Finally, since $r \mapsto \exp(f_r)$ is smooth and the composition with smoothmaps is a smooth operation, the local lift $r \mapsto \phi_r$ of $\F$ along $\hat x_0$, in $\CSDiff(\M)$, is smooth. Therefore, $\hat x_0$ is a diffeological principal fibration. The homogeneity of manifolds has first been proved by Donato in his dissertation \cite{Don84}.Let $\T(\M)$ be the tangent bundle to $\M$, that is, the space of $1$-jets of pathsin $\M$. Precisely, $\T(\M)$ is the quotient of $\Paths(\M)$ by the equivalence relation $\gamma \sim \gamma'$ if $\gamma(0) = \gamma'(0)$, andfor all differential $1$-forms $\alpha$ on $\M$, $\alpha(\gamma)(0) = \alpha(\gamma')(0)$. Then, $\T(\M)$ is the associated fiber bundle $\CSDiff(\M) \times_{\CSDiff(\M, x_0)} \E$, where $\E = \T_{x_0}(\M) = \quotient{\Paths(\M,x_0,\star)}{\sim}$.\endsolexref%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  Exercises %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\SkipTocEntry\section*{Coverings of Diffeological Spaces}\solexref{Covering-tori}(Covering tori)First of all, since $(\RR^n,+)$ is a group and $\Gamma \subset \RR^n$ is a subgroup, the projection$p : \RR^n \to \Torus_\Gamma$ is a fibration \art{Fibrations-of-groups-by-subgroups}, a principal fibration.Then, thanks to the unicity, up to equivalence, of universal coverings \art{The-universal-covering}, since $\RR^n$ is simply connected and $\Gamma$ is discrete, $p : \RR^n \to \Torus_\Gamma$ is the universal covering of $\Torus_\Gamma$, and $\Gamma$ identifieswith $\pi_1(\Torus_\Gamma)$. Now every path $t \mapsto t \gamma$, where $\gamma \in \Gamma$, projectsinto a loop in $\Torus_\Gamma$. This family of loops, one by element of $\Gamma$, gives a favorite representative for each element of $\pi_1(\Torus_\Gamma,\id_{\Torus_\Gamma})$, that is,each class of homotopy of loop based at $\id_{\Torus_\Gamma} = p(0)$. Next, considering the circle,we know that the map $p : t \mapsto(\cos(t), \sin(t))$ is a subduction, making the circle $\S^1 \subset \RR^2$diffeomorphic to $\RR/2\pi\ZZ$, see \exref{Subduction-onto-the-circle}. Each loop of $\S^1$ is then homotopic to some $t \mapsto p(2\pi kt)$, for $k \in \ZZ$. But $p(2\pi tk) = (\cos(2\pi kt), \sin(2\pi kt))$ is also equal to $\cR(2\pi kt)(\id_{\S^1})$. By translation with an element of $\S^1$, we get the general statement.\endsolexref%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  Exercises %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\SkipTocEntry\section*{Integration Bundle of Closed 1-forms}\solexref{De-Rham-homomorphism-and-irrational-tori}(De Rham homomorphism and irrational tori)There are two different cases, $s = \alpha r$ and $s \neq \alpha r$.\alinea{\sc 1.

Therefore, the map $r \mapsto \hat x_r$  is locally constant and the fiber in $\X_\alpha$ over $\xo$,  equipped with the subset diffeology, is discrete.\endsolexref%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  Exercises %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\SkipTocEntry\section*{Connections on Diffeological Fiber Bundles}\solexref{Spheric-periods-on-toric-bundles} (Spheric periods on toric bundles)Since $\sigma$ belongs to $\Loops(\Loops(\X,x), \bmx)$, wehave $\sigma(0)(t) = \sigma(1)(t) = \sigma(s)(0) =\sigma(s)(1) = x$ for all $s,t$, that is, $\sigma \circj_1(0) = \sigma \circj_1(1) = \sigma \circj_2(0) =\sigma \circj_2(1) = \bmx$, where $j_k$ is defined in\art{Boundary-of-cubes-and-chains}.

Then, choosing a point $y_0 \in \Y_x$ andidentifying $\Y_x$ with $\Torus$, thanks to the orbit map$\tau \mapsto \tau_\Y(y_0)$, we can regard the$\gamma_i$ as paths in $\Torus$, describing a close circuitstarting and ending at $0 \in \Torus$. But since $\RR$ is acovering of $\Torus$ (actually, the universal covering),thanks to the monodromy theorem, we can lift each path$\gamma_i$ by a path $x_i$ in $\RR$, $\gamma_i(t) =\class(x_i(t))$. Moreover, we can choose theseliftings such that $x_1(0) = 0$, $x_1(1) = x_2(0)$,$x_2(1) = x_3(0)$, $x_3(1) = x_4(0)$, and since$\gamma_4(1) = 0$, $x_4(1) \in \Gamma$.

Thus, it is sufficient, for the exercise, to assume the fiber bundle to be principal. Let $\pi : \Y \to \Torus_\Gamma$ be a principal fiber bundle with structure group $\G$. Let $p : \RR^n \to \Torus_\Gamma$ be the universal covering. The pullback $\pr_1 : p^*(\Y) \to \RR^n$ is a $\G$-principal fiber bundle, with the action $g(x,y) = (x,g_\Y(y))$, where $g_\Y$ denotes the action of $g \in \G$ on $\Y$. Since the base of the pullback is $\RR^n$, the fibration is trivial \art{Triviality-over-global-plots}. Therefore, it admits a smooth section, that is, there exists $\varphi \in \Cinfty(\RR^n,\Y)$ such that $\pi \circ \varphi = p$. Then, for each $x \in \RR^n$ and each $\gamma \in \Gamma$,there exists $h(\gamma)(x) \in \G$ such that $\varphi(x) = h(\gamma)(x)_\Y(\varphi(x+\gamma))$.Thus, $h \in \Maps(\Gamma, \Cinfty(\RR^n,\G))$ and $h(\gamma + \gamma')(x) = h(\gamma)(x) \cdot h(\gamma')(x+\gamma)$.Note also that, since $\Gamma$ is Abelian, $h(\gamma)(x) \cdot h(\gamma')(x+\gamma) =  h(\gamma')(x) \cdot h(\gamma)(x+\gamma')$.Next, $\pr_2 : p^*(\Y) \to \Y$ is a subduction, indeedif $r \mapsto y_r$ is a plot of $\Y$, then locally $y_r = \pr_2(x_r,y_r)$, where $r \mapsto x_r$ is a local lift in $\RR^n$ of $r \mapsto \pi(y_r)$. Then, $\Y$ is equivalent to the quotient of $\RR^n \times \G$by the action of $\Gamma$ induced by $h$, that is,$\gamma(x,g) = (x + \gamma, g \cdot h(\gamma)(x))$. Conversely, given such a map $h$,we get a $\G$-principal fiber bundle by quotient. These maps $h$ are kinds of cocycles, the above construction gives a trivial bundle if and only if $h$ is trivial, that is,if and only if there exists $f \in \Cinfty(\RR^n, \G)$ such that  $h(\gamma)(x) = f(x)^{-1} \cdot f(x+\gamma)$, such $h$ can be regarded as coboudaries.\endsolexref\solexref{Flat-connections-on-toric-bundles} (Flat connections on toric bundles)Let $\pi : \Y \to \X$ be a $\Torus$-principal bundle, with $\Torus$ a $1$-dimensional torus. Let $\lambda$ be a connection $1$-form and let us assume that $\Theta$, the associated connection, is flat, which means, by definition, that the holonomy group is discrete \art{The-holonomy-of-a-connection}.

But since $\Y_\Theta(y)$ is a covering, there is one and only onelift of $\pi \circ \gamma$ in $\Y_\Theta(y)$ starting at $y$, thus$\Theta(\gamma,0) = \gamma$. Hence, all the $1$-plots in $\Y_\Theta(y)$ are horizontaland $\lambda(\gamma) = 0$ for all $\gamma \in \Paths(\Y_\Theta(y))$.Therefore, the connection form $\lambda$ vanishes on $\Y_\Theta(y)$ \art{The-k-forms-are-defined-by-the-k-plots}, that is, $j^*(\lambda) = 0$.

Let $\A$ be a primitive of $a$, we getby integration, $\tau(k)(x) - \tau(k)(0) = \A(x) - \A(0) - \A(x+k) + \A(k)$.Then, $\tau(k)(x) = \B(k) + \sigma(x+k) - \sigma(x)$, for some $\B : \Gamma \to \RR$ and $\sigma \in \Cinfty(\RR)$. Thus, $\tau$ is equivalent to $\B$\xart{R-bundles-over-irrational-tori-and-small-divisors}{($\heartsuit$)}. The condition of cocycle writes then$\B(k+k') = \B(k) + \B(k')$, and $\B$ is a homomorphism from $\Gamma$ to $\RR$.Therefore, if there exists a connection $1$-form on $\Y$, then the cocycle $\tau$defining $\pi$ is equivalent to a homomorphism. Conversely, if $\tau$ is equivalent to a homomorphism $\B$, we just consider $\tau = \B$.Then, any $1$-form $\Lambda_{(x,t)} : (\delta x, \delta t) \mapsto a(x) \delta x + \delta t$, where $a$ is a $\Gamma$-invariant real function on $\RR$, is invariant by the action of $\Gamma$ on $\RR \times \RR$, and since $\RR \times \RR$ is a covering of the quotient $\Y = \RR \times_\Gamma \RR$, there exists a $1$-form $\lambda$on $\Y$ such that $\pr^*(\lambda) = \Lambda$ \art{Pushing-forms-onto-quotients}.Next, since $\Lambda$ is clearly a connection $1$-form, so is $\lambda$.In the special case $\Gamma = \ZZ + \alpha \ZZ$, a homomorphism writes$\B(n+\alpha m) = an + bm$ but considering the function $\sigma(x) = ax$, $\B$ is equivalent to $\beta(n + \alpha m) = cm$ for some constant $c$. If $c \neq 0$ then we can choose $c=1$, for simplicity. Thus, the quotient of $\RR \times \RR$ by the action $(n,(x,t)) \mapsto (x+n + \alpha m, t+m)$ of $\ZZ$ is equivalent tothe 2-torus $\Torus^2$, with$\Torus = \RR/\ZZ$, for the projection $(x,t)  \mapsto (\cl{t},\cl{x-\alpha t})$.\endsolexref%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  Exercises %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  \SkipTocEntry\section*{Integration Bundles of a Closed 2-Form}\solexref{Loops-in-the-torus} (Loops in the torus) The $1$-form $\CHK\omega$ restricted to $\Loops(\Torus^2)$ is closed,thanks to the fundamental property of the Chain-Homotopy operator.In particular, the restriction of $\CHK\omega$ to each component of $\Loops(\Torus^2)$ is closed.Let $\comp(\ell)$ be the connected component of $\ell$ in $\Loops(\Torus^2)$.The path $\sigma : s \mapsto \sigma_s$, with $\sigma_s(t) = \class(t,s)$, is a loop in $\Loops(\Torus^2)$, based at $\ell$, thus a loop in $\comp(\ell)$. Let us compute the integral of $\CHK\omega$ on $\sigma$, that is,$$\int_\sigma \CHK\omega = \int_0^1 \CHK\omega(\sigma)_s(1) \, ds.$$Let $\bar\sigma(t,s) = \sigma_s(t)$, and $\tilde \sigma$ be the lift of $\bar\sigma$in $\RR^2$, $\class \circ \tilde\sigma = \bar\sigma$, such that $\tilde\sigma(0,0) = (0,0)$, by definition,\begin{eqnarray*}\CHK\omega(\sigma)_s(1) & = & \int_0^1 \omega\left(\vect{t \\ s} \mapsto \sigma_s(t)\right)_{t \choose s}\vect{1 \\ 0} \vect{0 \\ 1} \, dt \\& = & \int_0^1 \omega(\bar \sigma)_{t \choose s} \vect{1 \\ 0} \vect{0 \\ 1} \, dt \\& = & \int_0^1 \bar\sigma^*(\omega)_{t \choose s} \vect{1 \\ 0} \vect{0 \\ 1} \, dt \\& = & \int_0^1 (\class \circ \tilde\sigma)^*(\omega)_{t \choose s} \vect{1 \\ 0} \vect{0 \\ 1} \, dt \\& = & \int_0^1 (\tilde\sigma)^*(\ee^1 \wedge \ee^2)_{t \choose s} \vect{1 \\ 0} \vect{0 \\ 1} \, dt \\& = & \int_0^1 \det\left[\D(\tilde\sigma)_{t \choose s}\right] \, dt.\end{eqnarray*}Hence,\begin{equation}\renewcommand{\theequation}{$\diamondsuit$}\int_\sigma \CHK\omega = \int_0^1 ds \int_0^1 dt \, \det\left[\D(\tilde\sigma)_{t \choose s}\right].\end{equation}In our case $\tilde\sigma$ is the identity and $\int_\sigma \CHK\omega = 1$.

Now,$\pi_1(\Torus,[0]) \simeq \ZZ$, each class is represented by a loop$t \mapsto [nt]$, with $n \in \ZZ$. Therefore, each class of loop in $\Torus^2$ is represented by a loop $\ell_{n,m} : t \mapsto ([nt],[mt])$.Now, let $s \mapsto \sigma_s$ be a loop in $\Loops(\Torus^2)$ based in $\ell_{n,m}$, the map $(t,s) \mapsto \sigma_s(t)$, from $\RR^2$ to $\Torus^2$has a unique lift $t \mapsto (x_s(t),y_s(t))$ in $\RR^2$ ---~that is,$\sigma_s(t) = ([x_s(t)],[y_s(t)])$~--- such that $(x_0(0), y_0(0)) = (0,0)$, \art{Monodromy-theorem}.Since $\sigma_0 = \ell_{n,m}$, $x_0(t) = nt + k$ and $y_0(t) = mt + k'$, but $(x_0(0), y_0(0)) = (0,0)$ implies $k=k'=0$. Then, $x_0(t) = nt$ and $y_0(t) = mt$. Next, since $\sigma_s$ is a loop,$\sigma_s(1) = \sigma_s(0)$, that is, $x_s(1) = x_s(0) + k$ and $y_s(1) = y_s(0) + k'$, with $k,k' \in \ZZ$.

Summarized, these conditions write$$ \begin{array}{ll} x_0(t) = nt \\ y_0(t) = mt \end{array} \quad\begin{array}{ll} x_1(t) = nt + k \\ y_1(t) = mt + k' \end{array} \quad\begin{array}{ll} x_s(1) -x_s(0) = n \\ y_s(1) - y_s(0) = m. \end{array}$$Now, let us define$$ \xi(u)_s(t) = \left( \begin{array}{ll} {[u(nt + sk) + (1-u)x_s(t)]} \\ {[u(mt + sk') + (1-u)y_s(t)]} \end{array} \right).$$With the conditions summarized above, we can check that $\xi(u)_s(0) = \xi(u)_s(1)$ and $\xi(u)_0(t) = \xi(u)_1(t) = \ell_{n,m}$.Thus, $\xi$ is a fixed-ends homotopy of loops connecting $\xi(0) = [s \mapsto \sigma_s]$ to $\xi(1) = [s \mapsto \sigma'_s]$, with$\sigma'_s(t) = ([nt + sk], [mt + sk'])$. Next, since $\CHK\omega \restriction \comp(\ell_{n,m})$ is closed, the integrals of $\CHK\omega$on the loops $[s \mapsto \sigma_s]$ and $[s \mapsto \sigma'_s]$ coincide,see \exref{Closed-1-forms-on-connected-spaces}.

We have,\begin{eqnarray*}  \omega(\P \circ \F)_s(\delta s, \delta's) & = &  \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} {\partial \over \partial s}  \left[{\partial \P(\F(s))(t) \over \partial t}\right](\delta s)   {\partial \P(\F(s))(t) \over \partial s}(\delta' s) \, dt \\  &=& \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} {\partial \over \partial r}  \left[{\partial \P(r)(t) \over \partial t}\right] \left({\partial r  \over \partial s}(\delta s) \right) {\partial \P(r)(t) \over  \partial r} \left({\partial r \over \partial s}(\delta' s)\right) \, dt \\  & = & \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} {\partial \over \partial r}  \left[{\partial \P(r)(t) \over \partial t}\right](\delta r)   {\partial \P(r)(t) \over \partial r}(\delta' r) \, dt \\  &=& \F^*(\omega(\P))_s(\delta s, \delta's).\end{eqnarray*}Thus, $\omega$ satisfies the conditions to be adifferential $2$-form on $\X$.\alinea{2)} Denoting$$  r = \vect{s \\ s'}, \quad \delta r = \vect{1 \\ 0}, \quad \delta'r = \vect{0 \\ 1}, \qmbox{and}  \P(r) = sf + s' g,  $$we have immediately$$  \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{2.5}  \begin{array}{rcccl}  \displaystyle{\partial \over \partial r}  \left[{\partial \P(r)(t) \over \partial t} \right] (\delta r) &=&  \displaystyle{\partial \over \partial s}{\partial \over  \partial t} \bigg(sf(t) +s'g(t)\bigg) &=& \dot f(t), \\  \displaystyle{\partial \P(r)(t)  \over \partial r}(\delta' r) & = &   \displaystyle{\partial \over \partial s'}  \bigg(sf(t)+s'g(t)\bigg) &=& g(t).  \end{array}  $$Then,$$  \omega\bigg( \vect{s \\ s'}  \mapsto sf + s'g \bigg)_{\left({s  \atop s'}\right)}\vect{1 \\ 0} \vect{0 \\ 1} =  \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \dot f(t) g(t) \ dt =  \bar\omega(f,g).  $$\alinea{3)} Let $u \in \X$ and $\P$ be a plot of $\X$. Using thenotations above, we have\begin{eqnarray*}  \T_u^*(\omega)(\P)_r(\delta r, \delta'r) & = &  \omega(\T_u \circ \P)_r(\delta r, \delta'r) \\  &=& \omega(r\mapsto \P(r) + u)_r(\delta r, \delta'r),\end{eqnarray*}and since $$  {\partial \over \partial r}\bigg(\P(r) + u\bigg) =   {\partial \P(r) \over \partial r},  $$we get $\omega(r\mapsto \P(r) +  u)_r(\delta r, \delta'r) = \omega(r\mapsto  \P(r))_r(\delta r, \delta'r)$, that is, $\T_u^*(\omega)    = \omega$.\alinea{4)} The space $\X$ is contractible. Indeed, the map $s  \mapsto sf$, $s \in \RR$, is a (smooth) deformationretraction connecting the constant map $f \mapsto 0$ to $\id_\X$. Thus, $\X$ is null-homotopic. Then,since the holonomy group is a homomorphicimage of $\pi_1(\X)$ \xart{The-holonomy-group}{2}, we get$\Gamma = \{0\}$.\alinea{5)} Since $\Gamma$ vanishes, the path moment map $\Psi(p)$,for a path $p$ connecting $f$ to $g$, depends only on theends $f$ and $g$, we can chose the path $p : s \mapsto sg +(1-s)f$. Let $\F$ be a plotof $\G$, that is, a plot of $\X$.

Now, a coboundary is defined by$\Delta c = [u \mapsto \Ad_*(u)(c) -c]$. But $\G$ isAbelian, thus $\Ad = \id_\G$, hence there is no non trivialcoboundary except $0$.

For all $p \in \Paths(\M)$, $\Psi(p)$ is a $1$-form on $\G$. Thus,$\Psi(p)$ is characterized by its values on the $1$-plots $\F : t \mapsto g_t$\art{The-k-forms-are-defined-by-the-k-plots}. But since $\Psi(p)$ is a left-invariant $1$-form, $\Psi(p)$ is characterized by its values on the $1$-plots pointed at $\id_\G$, that is, $\F(0) = \id_\G$.Next, since $\G$ is a Lie group, every path $\F$, pointed at $\id_\G$, is tangentto a homomorphism, thus we can assume that $\F \in \DHom(\RR,\G)$, and then $\F(t) = \exp(t\Z)$, with $\Z \in \eT_{\id_\G}(\G)$. According to\art{Value-of-the-moment-maps-for-manifolds}, since for $t=0$ and $\delta t = 1$,$$ \delta p(s) = [\D(\F(0))(p(s))]^{-1}  \left. {\partial \F(t)(p(s)) \over \partial t}\right|_{t = 0}(1) = \Z_\M(p(s)),$$we get$$\Psi(p)(\F)_0(1) = \int_0^1 \omega_{p(s)}(\dot p(s),\Z_\M(p(s))) \, ds.$$Now, let us assume that the action of $\G$ is Hamiltonian, that is,$\Psi(p)(\F)_0(1) = \mu(m')(\F)_0(1) - \mu(m)(\F)_0(1)$, with $m' = p(1)$ and $m = p(0)$. With our notation, that gives$\Psi(p)(\F)_0(1) = \mu_\Z(m') - \mu_\Z(m)$. Let us apply this computationto the path $p_s(t) = p(st)$. After a change of variable we get$$ \mu_\Z(m_s) = \int_0^s \omega_{p(t)}(\dot p(t),\Z_\M(p(t))) \, dt + \mu_\Z(m),$$with $m_s = p(s)$. The derivative of this identity, with respect to $s$, for $s=0$, gives then$$ \left. {\partial \mu_\Z(m_s) \over \partial s}\right|_{s=0} = \omega(\delta m,\Z_\M(m)), \qmbox{with} \delta m = \dot p(m).$$Therefore, with obvious notations, $\mu_\Z$ is the solution of the differential equation  $\omega(\Z_\M, \cdot ) = - d[\mu_\Z](\cdot)$, that is, $i_{\Z_\M} (\omega) = - d\mu_\Z$. Finally, decomposing $\Z$ in a basis $\{\xi^i\}_{i=1}^\N$ of the tangent space $\eT_{\id_\G}(\G)$, $\Z = \sum_{i=1}^\N \Z_i\, \xi^i$, gives $\mu_\Z(m) = \sum_{i=1}^\N \Z_i\, \mu_i(m)$,where $\mu_i = \mu_{\xi^i}$. Then,  $\bar \mu(m) : \Z \mapsto \mu_\Z(m)$ belongs to the dual$[\eT_{\id_\G}(\G)]^*$, which is identified with the space of momenta $\cG^*$.We find again, that way, the classical definition of the moment map $\bar \mu : \M \to [\eT_{\id_\G}(\G)]^*$, \cite{Sou70}.\endsolexref\solexref{The-cylinder-and-SL2R}(The cylinder and $\SL(2,\R)$)First of all, let $\X$ and $\X'$ be two vecteurs of $\RR^2$ and $\M \in \SL(2,\RR)$, $\omega(\M\X,\M\X') = \det(\M) \omega(\X,\X') = \omega(\X,\X')$,thus $\SL(2,\R)$ preserves $\omega$. Let us next check that $\SL(2,\R)$ is transitiveon $\RR^2 - \{0\}$. Let $\X = (x,y) \neq (0,0)$.

Let $f$ be a smooth realfunction defined on $\X$, let us denote by $\Q \times \P$ a plot of$\X \times \Omega^1(\X)$. We have $\bar f^*(\Taut)(\P  \times \Q)_r = \Taut(\bar f \circ (\Q \times \P))_r =  (\P(r) - df)(\Q)_r = \P(r)(\Q)_r - df(\Q)_r = \Taut(\Q  \times \P)_r - df(\pr_1 \circ (\Q \times \P))_r =  \Taut(\Q \times \P)_r - \pr_1^*(df)(\Q \times \P)_r$.Thus, $\bar f^*(\Taut) = \Taut - \pr_1^*(df)$. %Now let uscheck that this action is compatible with the $\Value$relation. Let $(x,\alpha)$ and $(x',\alpha')$ be twoelements of $\X \times \Omega^1(\X)$ such that$\Value(\alpha)(x) = \Value(\alpha')(x')$, that is, $x =  x'$ and, for every plot $\Q$ of $\X$ centered at $x$,$\alpha(\Q)_0 = \alpha'(\Q)_0$. Then, $(\alpha - df)(\Q)_0  = (\alpha' - df)(\Q)_0$ and $\Value(\alpha - df)(x) =    \Value(\alpha)(x) - \Value(df)(x)$,or $(\alpha - df)(x) = \alpha(x) - df(x)$. Thus, theaction of $\Cinfty(\X,\RR)$ projects on $\T^*\X$ as theaction $\bar f : (x,a) \mapsto a - df(x)$. Now, since$\bar f^*(\Taut) = \Taut - \pr_1^*(df)$, clearly  $\bar  f^*(\Liouv) = \Liouv - \pi^*(df)$. Put differently,$\bar f^*(\Liouv) = \Liouv  - d\F(f)$ with $\F \in    \Cinfty(\Cinfty(\X,\RR),\Cinfty(\T^*\X,\RR))$ and $\F(f) =      \pi^*(f) =f \circ \pi$.Let us denote by $\eR(x,a)$ the orbit map $f \mapsto a -  df(x)$. Let $p$ be a path in $\T^*\X$ such that $p(0) =    (x_0,a_0)$ and $p(1) = (x_1,a_1)$. By definition, for$\omega = d\Liouv$, $\Psi(p) = \hat p^*(\CHK  \omega) = \hat p^*(\CHK d\Liouv)$. Now, applying theproperty of the chain-homotopy operator $\CHK \circ d + d  \circ \CHK = \1^* - \0^*$, we get \begin{eqnarray*}  \Psi(p) & = & \hat p^*(\CHK d\Liouv) \\  & = & \hat p^*(\1^*(\Liouv) - \0^*(\Liouv) - d  \CHK\Liouv) \\  & = & (\1 \circ \hat p)^*(\Liouv) - (\0  \circ  \hat p)^*(\Liouv) - d [(\CHK\Liouv) \circ \hat p] \\  & = &  \eR(x_1,a_1)^*(\Liouv) - \eR(x_0,a_0)^*(\Liouv) - d [f   \mapsto \CHK\Liouv (\hat p(f))].\end{eqnarray*}Let us consider first the term $[f \mapsto \CHK\Liouv  (\hat p(f))]$. Let $p(t) =(x_t,a_t)$, then$\hat p(f) = [t \mapsto (x_t,a_t - df(x_t))]$. Thus,\begin{eqnarray*}  \CHK\Liouv(\hat p(f))) & = &\int_0^1 a_t[s \mapsto  x_s]_{s=t} \ dt - \int_0^1 df[t \mapsto x_t] \ dt \\  & = & \int_0^1  a_t[s \mapsto x_s]_{s=t} \ dt - [f(x_1) - f(x_0)].\end{eqnarray*}Hence, \begin{eqnarray*}  d [f   \mapsto \CHK\Liouv (\hat p(f))] &=& d\{f \mapsto \int_0^1  a_t[s \mapsto x_s]_{s=t} \ dt - [f(x_1) -  f(x_0)]\} \\  & = & - d[f \mapsto f(x_1) -  f(x_0)].\end{eqnarray*}Let us compute$\eR(x,a)^*(\Liouv)$, for $(x,a)$ in $\T^*\X$. Let$\P: \U \to \Cinfty(\X,\RR)$ be a plot, we have\begin{eqnarray*}  \eR(x,a)^*(\Liouv)(\P) & = & \Liouv (\eR(x,a) \circ  \P) \\  & = &  \Liouv(r \mapsto \overline{\P(r)}(x,a)) \\  & = & \Liouv(r \mapsto a + d[\P(r)](x)) \\  & = & (a +d[\P(r)](x))(r \mapsto x). \\  & = & 0.\end{eqnarray*}The last equality happens because the $1$-form $a + d[\P(r)](x)$ is evaluated onthe constant plot $r \mapsto x$, and every formevaluated on a constant plot vanishes. We get finally$$  \Psi(p) =  d[f \mapsto f(x_1)] - d[f \mapsto f(x_0)].   $$Now, clearly, $\Psi(p) = \psi(p(0),p(1))$, with $p(0)=(x_0,a_0)$ and $p(1) = (x_1,a_1)$.Then, the action of $\Cinfty(\X,\RR)$ isHamiltonian, $\Gamma = \{0\}$, and for the $2$-points moment map, we have$\psi((x_0,a_0),(x_1,a_1)) = \mu(x_1,a_1) - \mu(x_0,a_0)$, with $$  \mu : (x,a) \mapsto d[f \mapsto f(x)].  $$Noting $\delta_x$ the real function $f \mapsto f(x)$, $\mu(x,a) = d\delta_x$.Let us now check the invariance of $\mu$. Note that, for every$h \in \Cinfty(\X,\RR)$, $\delta_x \circ \eL(h) =  [f \mapsto f(x) + h(x)]$. Thus, for all $h \in    \Cinfty(\X,\RR)$, $\hat h^*(\mu)(x,a) =      \hat h^*(d \delta_x) = d(\delta_x \circ      \eL(h)) =  d [f \mapsto f(x) + h(x)]       =  d [f \mapsto f(x)] =  d \delta_x = \mu(x,a)$.Hence, $\mu$ is invariant, and it is a primitive of the $2$-points moment map $\psi$. Therefore, the Souriau class of the action of $\Cinfty(\X,\RR)$ on $\T^*\X$ vanishes. \endsolexref
