Jean-Marie was trying to generalize his  quantization procedure to a certain kind of coadjoint orbits of infinite dimensional   groups of diffeomorphisms.   He wanted to regard these groups of diffeomorphisms as Lie groups,  like everybody,  but he also wanted to avoid topological finessing, feeling  that that was not essential for this goal. He invented  then a lighter \guillemots{differentiable} structure on groups  of diffeomorphisms. These groups quickly became autonomous  objects. I mean: he gave up groups of diffeomorphisms for  abstract groups, equipped with an abstract differential  structure. He called them \guillemots{groupes diff\'erentiels},  this was the first name for the future diffeological groups.    \alinea{\bf \guillemots{Differential spaces} are born}   Listening to Jean-Marie talking about his differential groups,  I had the feeling that these structures, the axiomatics of  differential groups, could be easily extended to any  set, not necessarily groups, and I remember a  particularly hot discussion about this question in the  Luminy campus cafeteria. It was during a break  in our seminar. We were there, the whole group: JMS (as  we call him), Jimmy Elhadad, Christian Duval, Paul  Donato, Henry-Hugues Fliche, Roland Triay and myself.  Souriau denied the interest of considering anything else  than orbits of differential groups (Souriau was really,  but really, \guillemots{group-oriented}), and I decided when  I'd get the time --- I was working on the classification  of $\SO(3)$-symplectic manifolds which has nothing to do  with diffeology --- to generalize his axiomatics for any  sets. But I never got the opportunity to do it. Some  times later, days or weeks, I don't remember exactly, he  outlined the general theory of \guillemots{espaces  diff\'erentiels} as he called them. I would have liked  to do it, anyway... I must say that, at that time, these  constructions appeared to us, his students, as a fine  construction but so general that it could not turn out  into great results, it could give at most some intellectual  satisfaction. We were dubitative.   I decided to forget differential spaces and stay  focused on \guillemots{real maths}, the classification of  $\SO(3)$-symplectic manifolds. I went to  Moscow, spent a year there, and came back   with a complete classification in dimension 4 and  some general results in any dimension. This work  represented for me a probable doctoral thesis. It was  the first global classification theorem in symplectic  geometry after the homogeneous case, the  famous Kirillov-Kostant-Souriau theorem which states that any  homogeneous symplectic manifold is a covering of some  coadjoint orbit. But Jean-Marie didn't pay any attention  to my work, looking away from it, as he was completely  absorbed by his \guillemots{differential spaces}. I was really  disappointed, I thought that this work deserved to become  my doctorat. At the same time, Paul Donato gave a  general construction of the universal covering for any  quotient of \guillemots{differential groups}, that is, the  universal covering of any homogeneous \guillemots{differential  space}. This construction became his doctoral thesis. I decided  then to give up, for a moment, symplectic geometry and  to get into the world of differential spaces, since   it was the only subject about which JMS was able, or willing, to talk at that time.    \alinea{\bf The coming of the irrational torus} It was the year  1984, we were taking part in a conference about  symplectic geometry, in Lyon, when we decided, together  with Paul, to test diffeology on the {\em irrational torus},  the quotient of the 2-torus by an irrational line. This  quotient is not a manifold but remains a diffeological  space, moreover a diffeological group. We decided to call  it $\T_\alpha$, where $\alpha$ is the slope of the line.  The interest for this example came, of course, from the  Denjoy-Poincar\'e flow about which we heard so much  during this conference. What had diffeology to say  about this group, for which topology is completely dry? We  used the techniques worked out by Paul and computed its  homotopy groups, we found $\ZZ + \alpha \ZZ \subset \RR$   for the fundamental group and zero for the higher ones.  The real line  $\RR$ itself appeared as the universal  covering of $\T_\alpha$. I remember how we were excited  by this computation, as we didn't believe really in the  capabilities of diffeology for saying anything serious about such  \guillemots{singular} spaces or groups. Don't forget that differential spaces  had been introduced to study infinite dimensional groups and not   singular quotients.  We continued to explore  this group and found that, as diffeological space,  $\T_\alpha$ is characterized by $\alpha$, up to a  conjugation by $\GL(2,\ZZ)$, and we found that the  components of the group of diffeomorphisms of $\T_\alpha$  distinguish the cases where $\alpha$ is quadratic or not. It  became clear that diffeology was not such a trivial theory  and deserved to be more developed. At the same time,  Alain Connes introduced the first elements of  non-commutative geometry, and applied them to the  irrational flow on the torus --- our favorite example ---  and his techniques didn't give anything more (in fact  less) than the diffeological approach, which we  considered more in the spirit of ordinary geometry. We were in a good position   to know the application of Connes' theory  to irrational flows as he had many fans, in the Center  for Theoretical Physics at that time, developing his  ideas.    All in all, this example convinced me that diffeology was a  good tool, not as weak as it seemed to be.   And I decided to continue to explore this path.   The result of the computation of the homotopy group  of $\T_\alpha$ made me think that everything was as if  the irrational flow was a true fibration of the 2-torus:  the fiber $\RR$ being contractible the homotopy of the  quotient $\T_\alpha$ had to be the same as the total  space $\T^2$,   and one should avoid Paul's group specific techniques to get it.  But, of course, $\T_\alpha$ being  topologically trivial it could not be an ordinary locally  trivial fibration. I decided to investigate this question and,  finally, gave a definition of diffeological fiber  bundles, which are not locally trivial, but locally  trivial along the plots ---~the smooth  parametrizations defining the diffeology. I  showed two important things for me: the first one was  that the quotient of a diffeological group by any subgroup   is a diffeological fibration, and thus $\T^2 \to \T_\alpha$.   The second point was that diffeological fibrations satisfy the exact  homotopy sequence. I was done, I understood why the  homotopy of $\T_\alpha$, computed with the techniques  elaborated by Paul, gave the homotopy of $\T^2$, because  of the exact homotopy sequence. I spent one year on  this job, and I returned to Jean-Marie with that  and some examples. He agreed to listen to me  and decided that it could be my dissertation. I defended it in  November 1985, and became since then completely involved in  the diffeology adventure.     \alinea{\bf Differential, differentiable or diffeological spaces?} The  choice of the wording \guillemots{diffe\-ren\-tial spaces}  or \guillemots{differential groups} was not very happy, because  \guillemots{differential} is already used in maths and has some  kind of copyright, especially \guillemots{differential groups}  which are groups with an operation of derivation. This was  quoted often to us. I remember Daniel Kastler insisting  that JMS change this name. From time to time we tried to  find something else, without success. Finally, it was  during the defense of Paul's thesis, if memory serves  me right, when Van Est suggested the word  \guillemots{diff\'eologie} like \guillemots{topologie} as a replacement  of \guillemots{diff\'erentiel}. We found the word accurate and  we decided to use it, and \guillemots{espaces diff\'erentiels}  became \guillemots{espaces diff\'eologiques}. There was a damper,  however, \guillemots{diff\'erentiel} as well as  \guillemots{topologique} have four spoken syllables when  \guillemots{diff\'eologique} has five. Anyway, I used and abused  this new denomination, many friends laughed at me, and   one of them once told me: your   \guillemots{dix f\'ees au logis} --- which means \guillemots{ten fairies  at home} ---~since then, there is no time when I use  diffeology without thinking of these ten fairies waiting  at home... Later, Daniel Bennequin pointed out to me that  Kuo-Tsai Chen, in his work about {\em Iterated path  integrals} \cite{Che77}, in the '70s, defined  \guillemots{differentiable spaces} which looked a lot like  \guillemots{diffeological spaces}. I got to the library,  read Chen's paper and drew the conclusion that our  \guillemots{diffeological spaces} were just equivalent to  Chen's \guillemots{differentiable spaces}, the slight difference  in the definition giving, however, the same category. I  was very disappointed, I was working on a subject I thought  really new and it appeared to be known and already worked  out. I decided to drop \guillemots{diffeology} for  \guillemots{differentiable} and to give honor to Chen, but my  attempt to use Chen's vocabulary aborted, the word  \guillemots{diffeology} had already moved into practice, having  myself helped to popularize it. However, I must admit  that, although Chen's and Souriau's axiomatics lead to the  same category, Souriau's choice is better adapted  to our geometrical point of view. Defining plots on open domains,  rather than on standard simplices, changes dramatically  the scope of the theory.     \alinea{\bf Last word?} I would add some words about the use or misuse of  diffeology. Some friends have expressed their skepticism  about diffeology, and told me that they are waiting for  diffeology to prove something great. Well, I don't know  any theory proving anything, but I know mathematicians  proving theorems. Let me put it differently, number theory  doesn't prove any theorem, mathematicians solve problems  raised by number theory. A theory is just a framework to  express questions and pose problems,   it is a playground.   The solutions of these problems depend on the skill of the  mathematicians who are interested in them. As a framework to  formulate questions in differential geometry, I think  diffeology is a very good one, it offers good tools,  simple axioms, simple vocabulary, simple but rich  objects, it is a stable category, and it opens a wide field of  research. Now, I understand my friends, there are so many  attempts to extend the usual category of differential  geometry, and so much expectations, that it is legitimate to be doubtful.  Nevertheless, I think that we have now enough convincing  examples, simple or more elaborated, for which  diffeology brings concrete and formal results. And this  is an encouragement to persist on this path,  developing new diffeological tools, and perhaps to prove  some day, some great theorem :).    \alinea{\em By the time I began this book, Jean-Marie Souriau was alive and well.  He asked me frequently about my progress. He was eager to know if   people were buying his theory and he was happy when I could say sometimes that,   yes, some people in Tel-Aviv or in Texas, mentioned it in some papers or discussed it  on some web forum.   Now, when I'm finishing this book and writing the last sentences,   Jean-Marie is no longer with us. He will not see the book published and complete.  It is sad, Diffeology was his last program, in which he had strong expectations  regarding geometric quantization. I am not sure if diffeology   will fulfill his expectations, but I am sure that it is now a mature theory,  and I dedicate this work to his memory.   Whether it is the right framework to achieve Souriau's quantization program   is still an open question.}\end{chaphead}
