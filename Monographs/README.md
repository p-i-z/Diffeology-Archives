This directory contains the source code for the definitive reference monograph on the theory of Diffeology. This book provides the complete axiomatic foundation for the subject, develops its core tools (such as differential forms and homotopy), and explores its applications to various geometric objects.

## Two Archived Editions

This archive contains two distinct versions of the text, each serving a specific purpose.

*   **/AMS-2013-Edition/**: This subdirectory holds the source for the original version as it was published by the American Mathematical Society in 2013. This version is provided for historical reference and to allow researchers to verify citations made against the original publication.

*   **/Beijing-2022-Edition/**: This subdirectory holds the source for the revised and corrected version published by Beijing World Publishing Corp. in 2022. It contains fixes for known misprints and a correction to a mathematical mistake present in the original text. **This is the recommended version for all new readers and for general study.**

The goal of this archive is to provide both the historical version of record and the most accurate, living version of the theory's foundational text.
