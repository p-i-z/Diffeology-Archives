## Abstract

We present an example of symplectic reduction in diffeology where the space involved is infinite dimensional and the reduction is singular. This example is a mix of two cases that are not handled by ordinary symplectic geometry. We show that, in this infinite dimensional example, the singularities are distributed in such a way that the symplectic form, restricted to a generic level of the moment map, passes to the reduced space.

## Significance: Infinite Dimensions and Singularities

This paper serves as a stress test and a demonstration of the power of Diffeology. It tackles a scenario that combines two major difficulties in classical symplectic geometry: **infinite dimensionality** and **singular reduction**.

Key contributions include:
1.  **The Infinite Quasi-Projective Space:** It constructs the space of Fourier coefficients of periodic functions, equips it with a symplectic structure, and performs a reduction by the "irrational solenoid" (the real line induced densely into the infinite torus).
2.  **Parasymplectic Structures:** It demonstrates that despite the singular nature of the quotient, the symplectic form descends to a well-defined closed 2-form (parasymplectic form) on the reduced space.
3.  **Classification of Symplectic Spaces:** The introduction proposes a classification of symplectic diffeological spaces based on two criteria: the transitivity of local automorphisms and the discreteness of the moment map's prevalues. This example fits into the most general and difficult category, where neither condition holds, yet Diffeology provides a rigorous framework for analysis.
