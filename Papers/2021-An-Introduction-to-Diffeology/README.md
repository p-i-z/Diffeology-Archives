## Abstract

This text presents the basics of Diffeology and the main domains: Homotopy, Fiber Bundles, Quotients, Singularities, Cartan-de Rham Calculus — which form the core of differential geometry — from the point of view of this theory. We show what makes diffeology special and relevant in regard to these traditional subjects.

## Significance: The Irrational Torus and Klein's Program

This work serves as both a foundational introduction and a philosophical manifesto for Diffeology. Its significance lies in three key arguments presented by the author:

1.  **The Irrational Torus as Ariadne's Thread:** The paper uses the irrational torus $T_\alpha$ as a running example to demonstrate the unique capability of Diffeology. Where topology sees a trivial space (coarse topology) and other differential theories see a discrete set, Diffeology reveals a rich structure with a non-trivial fundamental group, cohomology, and group of diffeomorphisms. This proves that Diffeology captures the "DNA" of a space even when it is topologically singular.

2.  **A Return to Felix Klein:** The paper concludes by explicitly connecting Diffeology to Felix Klein's Erlangen Program. It proposes that Diffeology provides the formal framework to regard **Differential Geometry** as the geometry of the **group of diffeomorphisms** (the "active approach"), rather than just the study of charts and atlases (the "passive approach").

3.  **Symplectic Universality:** It demonstrates how advanced structures, such as the moment map in symplectic geometry, exist naturally in Diffeology without requiring the pre-existence of a Lie algebra, thus unifying finite and infinite-dimensional symplectic mechanics.

## Note on the Erlangen Program (2025 Update)

In the conclusion of this text, the author proposes that Diffeology fulfills Felix Klein's Erlangen Program by treating the group of diffeomorphisms as the principal geometric object.

However, the author's later work, **"The Boman Paradox" (2025)** (also available in this archive), provides a rigorous counter-example to this strict view. By constructing the "Wire Plane"—a space topologically and algebraically indistinguishable from the standard plane but geometrically distinct—it demonstrates that the abstract group of symmetries is not always sufficient to reconstruct the geometric space. This necessitates a refinement of the Kleinian perspective: the geometry is determined by the pair formed by the diffeological space and its diffeological symmetry group, where the local structure of the space is primary.
