## Abstract

We identify the category of manifolds with boundary and corners with a subcategory of the category {Diffeology}. Then, we show that any differential form on a manifold with boundary or corners, embedded in a smooth manifold, extends to a differential form on an open neighbourhood. As an example of application, we discuss the structure of $\text{SO}(2)^n$ invariant closed 2-forms on $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$.

## Significance: Rigor at the Boundary

This paper addresses a fundamental technical issue in differential geometry: how to define and manipulate differential forms on spaces that are not smooth manifolds in the traditional sense, specifically those with boundaries and corners (like the positive orthant $\mathbb{K}^n$).

The paper establishes two key results:
1.  **Categorical Equivalence:** It proves that the classical definition of manifolds with corners (via charts mapping to $\mathbb{K}^n$) is equivalent to the diffeological definition (spaces locally diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{K}^n$ equipped with the subset diffeology). This confirms that Diffeology naturally encompasses this standard category without modification.
2.  **The Extension Theorem:** It proves that every differential form defined on a manifold with corners is the restriction of a smooth form defined on an open neighborhood. This result validates the intuitive manipulation of forms on boundaries and corners used in Stokes' theorem and other analytical contexts.
