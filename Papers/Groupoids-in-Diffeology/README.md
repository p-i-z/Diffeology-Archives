## Abstract

This expository paper recounts the development and application of the concept of the diffeological groupoid, from its introduction in 1985 to its use in current research. We demonstrate how this single concept has served as a powerful and unifying tool for defining fundamental structures, analyzing the stratification of complex spaces like orbifolds, building a bridge to noncommutative geometry, and, most recently, forging new approaches to geometric quantization. The paper aims to provide a cohesive narrative of this journey, making explicit certain concepts like the "Klein groupoid" and showcasing the enduring vitality of the diffeological groupoid in modern geometry and physics.

## Significance of the Paper

This survey paper provides a unified narrative of the theory and application of the **diffeological groupoid**, a concept central to the development of modern diffeology. The paper argues that for singular spaces—which are not locally homogeneous and thus fall outside the classical Kleinian framework—the groupoid is the essential tool for capturing local symmetries.

The paper traces the evolution of this concept through several key applications:
1.  **Foundations:** It explains how the challenge of describing the irrational torus led to the definition of the diffeological groupoid, which in turn provided a robust theory of fibrations and universal coverings for all diffeological spaces, bypassing the local niceness conditions required in classical topology.
2.  **Stratification:** It details how the **structure groupoid** of an atlas and the intrinsic **Klein groupoid** of local diffeomorphisms serve as powerful analytical instruments for understanding the singularity structure of orbifolds, quasifolds, and orbit spaces.
3.  **Noncommutative Geometry:** It recounts the pivotal role of the diffeological groupoid in forging a concrete, functorial bridge between the geometry of singular spaces (like quasifolds) and the algebra of C*-algebras, showing that the construction yields a true Morita equivalence invariant.
4.  **Geometric Quantization:** It presents the most recent application in a new, path-based approach to geometric quantization, where the **prequantum groupoid** replaces the classical prequantum line bundle, bypassing the integrality condition and preserving all symmetries of the system.

By making explicit the unifying role of the Klein groupoid and synthesizing three decades of research, this paper demonstrates how a single, powerful idea has provided solutions and new insights across a wide range of problems in geometry and mathematical physics.
