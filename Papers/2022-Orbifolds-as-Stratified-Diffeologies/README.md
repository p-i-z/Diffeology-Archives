## Abstract

We discuss general properties of stratified spaces in diffeology. This leads to a formal framework for the theory of stratifications. In particular, we consider the Klein stratification of diffeological orbifolds, defined by the action of local diffeomorphisms. We show that it is a standard stratification in the sense that the partition of the space into orbits of local diffeomorphisms is locally finite (for orbifolds with locally finite atlases), it satisfies the frontier condition, and the orbits are locally closed manifolds.

## Significance: Resolving the Stratification Conflict

A recurrent problem in the classical theory of stratified spaces is the competition between two distinct structures: the global topology of the space and the smooth manifold structure of the strata within it.

This paper demonstrates how Diffeology resolves this conflict. By nature, diffeology absorbs singularities into its definition. The paper introduces a formal framework for stratification based on the **Klein Stratification**—the partition of a space by the orbits of its local diffeomorphisms.

It establishes a classification system (using codes like `[B]-[LF]-[GK]-[M]-[T0]`) to describe stratifications and proves a central theorem: **The natural stratification of a diffeological orbifold is "standard"**—meaning it satisfies the frontier condition, is locally finite, and its strata are locally closed manifolds. This confirms that Diffeology provides the correct smooth framework for singular spaces without requiring heuristic reconciliation between topology and geometry.
