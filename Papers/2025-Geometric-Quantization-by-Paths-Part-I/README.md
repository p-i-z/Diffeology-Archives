## Abstract

For any connected and simply connected parasymplectic space $(\mathcal{X},\omega)$ with group of periods $P_\omega \subsetneq \mathbf{R}$, we construct a prequantum groupoid $\mathcal{T}_\omega$ as a diffeological quotient of the space of paths in $\mathcal{X}$. This object, built from the geometry of the classical system, serves as a unified structure for prequantization.

The groupoid $\mathcal{T}_\omega$ has $\mathcal{X}$ as its objects, and its space of morphisms $\mathcal{Y}$ carries a canonical left-right invariant 1-form $\boldsymbol{\lambda}$ whose curvature encodes $\omega$. A key property is that the isotropy group at any point $x$, naturally arising as a quotient of the space of loops, is isomorphic to the torus of periods $T_\omega = \mathbf{R}/P_\omega$. Furthermore, the entire symmetry group $\mathrm{Diff}(\mathcal{X}, \omega)$ acts as faithful automorphisms of $(\mathcal{T}_\omega, \boldsymbol{\lambda})$ without central extensions at this level.

Built within the framework of diffeology, this construction generalizes classical prequantization by applying to broad classes of spaces, including those with singularities or infinite-dimensional aspects, and by accommodating generalized (e.g., irrational) tori of periods. This paper focuses on the simply connected case; the construction will be extended to general diffeological spaces in a subsequent publication.
