## Abstract

We investigate the correspondence between the geometry of a smooth compact Lie group action on a manifold $\M$ and the intrinsic smooth structure of the orbit space $\M/\G$. While the action on $\M$ is classically organized by the orbit-type stratification, we show this structure fails to predict the intrinsic Klein stratification of the quotient, which partitions the space into the orbits of local diffeomorphisms, thereby classifying the space by its intrinsic singularity types. The correct correspondence, we prove, is governed by a finer partition on $\M$: the *isostabilizer decomposition*. We establish a surjective map from the components of this partition to the Klein strata of $\M/\G$. As a corollary, we obtain by pullback a new canonical stratification on $\M$, the *Inverse Klein Stratification*, and clarify its relationship with classical structures.

## Significance of the Paper

This paper resolves a long-standing ambiguity in the study of singular spaces. The classical tool for analyzing a group action on a manifold, the **orbit-type stratification**, is an extrinsic structure that does not reliably predict the intrinsic geometry of the resulting quotient space.

This work provides the definitive solution by identifying the correct predictive tool: the finer **isostabilizer decomposition** on the source manifold. The main result is the **Correspondence Theorem**, which establishes a surjective map from this decomposition to the intrinsic **Klein stratification** (the local diffeomorphism orbits) of the quotient space.

This theorem provides an exact "dictionary" between the action's local data (stabilizer and slice representation) and the quotient's singularity types. It also leads to the definition of a new canonical stratification on the source manifold, the "Inverse Klein Stratification," clarifying the full hierarchy of partitions. The paper concludes that the quotient space possesses an intrinsic geometric identity as an **orthofold**, which can be independent of the specific global action that created it.
