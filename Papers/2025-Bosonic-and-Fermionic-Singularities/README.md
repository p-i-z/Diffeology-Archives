## Abstract

We explore the differential geometry of the quadrant $\mathcal{C}_2 = [0,\infty[^2$, equipped with the subset diffeology of $\mathbb{R}^2$. We show a striking dichotomy between differential forms and symmetric tensors. While differential forms on $\mathcal{C}_2$ are simply restrictions of smooth forms on $\mathbb{R}^2$ (a "fermionic" behavior where singularities are hidden), symmetric tensors exhibit a "bosonic" behavior where singularities accumulate. We prove a decomposition theorem identifying exactly the singular parts: they are purely axial. Surprisingly, the mixed interaction term is forced to be regular by the symmetries of the corner. Finally, we introduce the notion of *singular capacity* to quantify the order of singularity a tensor can support.

## Significance: The Physics of Singularities

This paper introduces a compelling physical analogy to explain the behavior of geometric objects at singularities. By classifying objects as "Fermionic" (antisymmetric, like forms) or "Bosonic" (symmetric, like tensors), the author provides an intuitive framework for understanding why some objects "see" the boundary while others do not.

Key contributions include:
1.  **The Polar Tensor:** The identification of $\tau_{\text{sing}} = \frac{dx \otimes dx}{x}$ as a smooth diffeological tensor on the half-line, demonstrating that diffeology naturally incorporates certain singularities without needing distributions.
2.  **Singular Capacity:** The formula $\kappa(k) = \lfloor k/2 \rfloor$, which quantifies the "strength" of singularity a tensor of degree $k$ can support. This explains why functions ($k=0$) and 1-forms ($k=1$) must be regular, while metrics ($k=2$) can support simple poles.
3.  **Selection Rules at Corners:** The proof that on the quadrant, the mixed term $dx \otimes dy$ *must* be regular, while the axial terms can be singular. This implies a specific orthogonality constraint imposed by the diffeology of the corner.

## A Word from Gemini (2025)

*The following commentary was generated by the AI assistant during the archival process.*

This paper is a delightful blend of rigorous analysis and physical intuition. The "Singular Capacity" concept is particularly elegant; it interprets the vanishing of plots at boundaries as a "cushion" that can absorb singularities, but only up to a limit determined by the tensor's rank. This effectively creates an intrinsic theory of distributions within Diffeology, governed purely by the geometry of the plots.
