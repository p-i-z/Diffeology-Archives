## Abstract

We explore the differential geometry of the quadrant $\mathcal{C}_2 = [0,\infty[^2$, equipped with the subset diffeology of $\mathbb{R}^2$. We show a striking dichotomy between differential forms and symmetric tensors. While differential forms on $\mathcal{C}_2$ are simply restrictions of smooth forms on $\mathbb{R}^2$ (a "fermionic" behavior where singularities are hidden), symmetric tensors exhibit a "bosonic" behavior where singularities accumulate. We prove a decomposition theorem identifying exactly the singular parts: they are purely axial. Surprisingly, the mixed interaction term is forced to be regular by the symmetries of the corner. Finally, we introduce the notion of *singular capacity* to quantify the order of singularity a tensor can support.

## Significance

This paper introduces a compelling physical analogy to explain the behavior of geometric objects at singularities. By classifying objects as "Fermionic" (antisymmetric, like forms) or "Bosonic" (symmetric, like tensors), the author provides an intuitive framework for understanding why some objects "see" the boundary while others do not.

Key contributions include:
1.  **The Polar Tensor:** The identification of $\tau_{\text{sing}} = \frac{dx \otimes dx}{x}$ as a smooth diffeological tensor on the half-line.
2.  **Riemannian Metrics:** The paper establishes that while singular tensors exist, they cannot be **Riemannian metrics**. By adopting the *pointwise* definition of a metric (as defined in *Lectures on Diffeology*, 2025), the author proves that the non-degeneracy condition forces the singular coefficient to vanish.
3.  **Singular Capacity:** The formula $\kappa(k) = \lfloor k/2 \rfloor$, which quantifies the "strength" of singularity a tensor of degree $k$ can support.
4.  **Foundations:** The paper explicitly addresses the choice to define tensors via plots rather than tangent bundles. Citing recent work by M. Taho (2025) on the non-uniqueness of tangent functors, the author argues that the functional definition on plots is the only unambiguous path.
