## Abstract

Diffeology extends differential geometry to spaces beyond smooth manifolds. This paper explores diffeology's key features and illustrates its utility with examples including singular and quotient spaces, and applications in symplectic geometry and prequantization. Diffeology provides a natural and effective framework for handling complexities from singularities and infinite-dimensional settings.

## Significance of the Paper

This paper serves as a programmatic overview and a compelling answer to the question, "Why Diffeology?". It is not a deep dive into a single technical result, but rather a high-level tour of the entire field, demonstrating its power, elegance, and necessity.

The work connects the core concepts of diffeology to the problems they were designed to solve, touching upon:
*   The intrinsic geometry of singular spaces like the irrational torus and orbifolds.
*   The definitive geometry of orbit spaces via the Klein stratification.
*   The resolution of paradoxes in symplectic geometry and geometric quantization.
*   The deep connections to noncommutative geometry.

This paper is the ideal entry point for mathematicians and physicists seeking to understand the motivation behind the diffeological framework and its potential to unify disparate areas of modern geometry. The personal dedication to Vladimir Arnold also frames the work within a rich historical and intellectual lineage.
