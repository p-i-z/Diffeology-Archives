## Abstract

Experimental neuroscience has long established that human motor control, specifically in hand movements, adheres to the "Two-Thirds Power Law," relating velocity to curvature ($v \propto \kappa^{-1/3}$). Geometrically, this implies that trajectories are geodesics of an equi-affine metric. However, in the standard framework of differential geometry, this metric is not intrinsic because its definition relies on acceleration, which is not a tensorial quantity under the full group of diffeomorphisms of $\mathbf{R}^2$. In this note, we propose a change in perspective: we model the brain's internal geometry not as the standard plane $\mathbf{R}^2$, but as the **Wire Plane** — $\mathbf{R}^2$ equipped with the *wire diffeology* generated by smooth curves. We prove that the equi-affine metric is founded upon a covariant 3-tensor which, in this specific diffeological context, becomes a natural and intrinsic object defined on the plots of the space. This mathematical result suggests a neuro-geometric hypothesis: the brain perceives and plans space through 1-dimensional paths rather than 2-dimensional charts.

## Significance of the Paper

This paper provides a novel diffeological solution to a geometric paradox in the study of human motor control. The experimentally observed Two-Thirds Power Law is naturally described by equi-affine geometry, but this geometry is not intrinsic to the standard manifold structure of the plane because it depends on acceleration.

The central proposal of this work is to resolve this by changing the underlying geometric structure itself. By replacing the standard 2-dimensional diffeology of the plane with the 1-dimensional **wire diffeology** (generated only by smooth curves), the paper demonstrates that the equi-affine metric becomes a perfectly well-defined and intrinsic tensor.

This leads to a powerful neuro-geometric hypothesis: the brain's motor cortex may not perceive and plan movement in a 2D space of charts, but in a 1D space of paths. The paper shows that Diffeology provides the unique framework where this hypothesis is geometrically coherent.
