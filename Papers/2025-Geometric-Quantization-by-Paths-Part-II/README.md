## Abstract

In Part I, we established the construction of the prequantum groupoid for simply connected spaces. This second part extends the theory to **arbitrary connected parasymplectic diffeological spaces** $(\mathcal X, \omega)$.

We identify the obstruction to the existence of the prequantum groupoid as the non-additivity of the integration of the prequantum form $\mathcal{K}\omega$ on the space of loops. By defining a **Total Group of Periods** $P_\omega$ directly on the space of paths, which absorbs the periods arising from the relations in homotopy of free loops, we construct a prequantum groupoid $\mathcal T_\omega$ with connected isotropy isomorphic to the torus of periods $T_\omega = \mathbf{R}/P_\omega$.

Furthermore, we propose that this groupoid $\mathcal T_\omega$ constitutes the **Quantum System** itself. The classical space $\mathcal X$ is embedded as the *skeleton* of units, surrounded by a *quantum fog* of morphisms. We prove that the group of automorphisms of the Quantum System is isomorphic to the group of symmetries of the Dynamical System, $\mathrm{Diff}(\mathcal X, \omega)$.

Finally, we revisit the theory of moment maps in diffeology. We show that the "paths moment map" defined in previous work is the intrinsic moment map of the quantum groupoid. The holonomy group $\Gamma$, previously viewed as an obstruction to the existence of a classical moment map, is reinterpreted here as a signature of strictly quantum geometrical features, such as the Aharonov-Bohm effect.
