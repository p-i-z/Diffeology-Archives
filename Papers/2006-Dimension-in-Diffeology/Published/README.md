## Abstract

We define the *dimension function* for diffeological spaces, a simple but new invariant. We show then how it can be applied to prove that, for two different integers $m$ and $n$ the quotient spaces $\RR^m\!/\mathrm{O}(m)$ and $\RR^n\!/\mathrm{O}(n)$ are not diffeomorphic, and not diffeomorphic to the half-line $[0,\infty) \subset \RR$.

## A Note on this Version

This is the concise, published version of the paper "Dimension in Diffeology." It is the result of a significant condensation of the original 23-page preprint, undertaken at the insightful request of the editor, Hans Duistermaat.

This version presents the main theorems and proofs in their most direct and economical form. As the author describes it, the result is a "dry math piece of result without soul"—a testament to the demands of journal publication, but also a showcase of the essential mathematical argument, stripped of figures, diagrams, and broader pedagogical context.

For the full developmental narrative, detailed explanations, and original motivation, the long preprint version located in the parent directory is the recommended reference.
