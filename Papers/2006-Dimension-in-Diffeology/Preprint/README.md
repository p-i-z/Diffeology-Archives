## Abstract

The notion of *dimension* for diffeologies, introduced here, generalizes the dimension of manifolds. More appropriate to diffeology is the *dimension map*. We give some elementary properties of this dimension under several diffeological constructions. We illustrate these definitions with the example of the quotient spaces $\Delta_n = \RR^n/\mathrm{O}(n)$ for which $\dim(\Delta_n) = n$, due to the singularity at the origin. Then, we deduce that the dimension of the half-line $\Delta_\infty = [0,\infty[ \subset \RR$, equipped with the subset diffeology, is infinite at the origin. And we show how this diffeological invariant can be used, in particular, to completely avoid topological considerations in some diffeological questions.

## A Note on this Version

This is the original, unabridged 23-page manuscript for "Dimension in Diffeology" as it was first submitted for publication in 2006. It contains the full, detailed development of the concept of dimension in diffeology, including extended examples and proofs.

This version is preserved in the archive for its pedagogical and historical value. It was this manuscript that, at the insightful request of the editor Hans Duistermaat, was later condensed into the concise 6-page article published in *Indagationes Mathematicae*. For students and researchers interested in the step-by-step construction and motivation of the theory, this long version remains an essential reference.
