## Abstract

The notion of *dimension* for diffeologies, introduced here, generalizes the dimension of manifolds. More appropriate to diffeology is the *dimension map*. We give some elementary properties of this dimension under several diffeological constructions. We illustrate these definitions with the example of the quotient spaces $\Delta_n = \mathbf{R}^n/\mathrm{O}(n)$ for which $\dim(\Delta_n) = n$, due to the singularity at the origin. Then, we deduce that the dimension of the half-line $\Delta_\infty = [0,\infty[ \subset \mathbf{R}$, equipped with the subset diffeology, is infinite at the origin. And we show how this diffeological invariant can be used, in particular, to completely avoid topological considerations in some diffeological questions.

## Scientific and Historical Significance

This paper provides the solution to a long-standing question that originated in the author's doctoral thesis. In his thesis, it was proven that the first two singular half-lines, $\Delta_1 = \mathbf{R}/\mathrm{O}(1)$ and $\Delta_2 = \mathbf{R}^2/\mathrm{O}(2)$, were not diffeomorphic. However, the proof relied on specific connectedness arguments related to the orbit structure, which did not generalize to higher dimensions. The question of whether $\Delta_n \not\equiv \Delta_m$ for $n \neq m$ remained an open problem without a clear entry point.

The breakthrough came years later, following an invitation to Spain from Enrique Macias. After a period of intense discussions, it was on the train journey back that the concept of **diffeological dimension** emerged as the missing tool. This new invariant, defined as the infimum of the dimensions of the generating plots, was powerful enough to distinguish the spaces.

This paper is the first formal development of that insight. It defines the dimension map and uses it to prove that $\dim(\Delta_n) = n$, providing a clean and definitive proof that all these spaces are distinct. It stands as a key example of how a purely diffeological invariant can solve a problem that was intractable with earlier methods.

## About the Two Versions in this Archive

This archive contains two distinct versions of this work:

1.  **The Long Preprint Version (23 pages):** This is the original, detailed manuscript submitted to *Indagationes Mathematicae* in 2006. It provides a full, pedagogical development of the concept of dimension in diffeology.
2.  **The Published Version (6 pages):** This is the concise version that was ultimately published in the journal, following the insightful editorial guidance of Hans Duistermaat, who encouraged a shorter, more focused presentation of the main results.

The long preprint is preserved here for its historical and pedagogical value, as it contains the original, unabridged exploration of the topic.

## Directory Structure

*   **/Preprint/:** Contains the original 23-page manuscript (`DID-Preprint.tex`) and its associated files.
*   **/Published/:** Contains the final 6-page published article (`DID-Published.tex`) and its files.
