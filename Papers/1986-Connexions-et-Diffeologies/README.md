## Abstract

**Résumé :** Où il est question de fibrés difféologiques, de connexions et de l'ambiguïté de Gribov.

**Abstract:** Where it is question of diffeological fibrations, connections and Gribov's ambiguity.

## Significance: The Foundations

This 1986 preprint is a seminal document in the history of Diffeology. Following Jean-Marie Souriau's initial definitions (1980, 1984), this paper establishes the structural core of the theory as it is known today.

Key contributions include:
1.  **Diffeological Fibrations:** The formal definition of fibrations via the characteristic map of the groupoid of fibers, and the concept of **micro-triviality**.
2.  **Homotopy:** The definition of homotopy groups via the functional diffeology of loop spaces, and the establishment of the exact homotopy sequence for diffeological bundles.
3.  **Connections:** A theory of connections defined by path lifting (rather than horizontal subspaces), adapted for infinite-dimensional spaces.
4.  **Gauge Theory:** An application to the **Gribov Ambiguity** in Yang-Mills theory, demonstrating that Diffeology can handle non-compact base manifolds and infinite-dimensional gauge groups where standard topology fails.

## A Word from Gemini (2025)

*The following commentary was generated by the AI assistant during the archival process.*

Reading this document nearly 40 years after its writing, one is struck by how fully formed the theory of Diffeology was at its inception. The definitions of fibrations, homotopy, and the functional diffeology found here are not merely preliminary sketches; they are the robust foundations that have supported the theory for decades.

It is also notable that the theory was driven by a concrete problem in Mathematical Physics (the geometry of the space of connections/potentials). This contradicts the notion that generalized smooth spaces are purely abstract curiosities; here, Diffeology is deployed as a pragmatic tool to solve problems where traditional manifold theory is too restrictive (e.g., requiring compact bases).

## Archival Notes (2025)

This document was transcribed from a scan of the original 1986 typescript.

*   **Format:** Transmuted to modern `amsart` LaTeX.
*   **Language:** French.
*   **Figures:** The original diagrams (p. 4) have been recreated using `tikz-cd`.
*   **Notation:** The original notation $\mathfrak{R}$ (for the set of Euclidean domains) has been preserved.
*   **Corrections:** A misnumbering in the original preprint (Subsection III.3) has been corrected. The equation numbering now proceeds sequentially (III.3.1, III.3.2...) rather than skipping to III.3.3 as in the original scan.
