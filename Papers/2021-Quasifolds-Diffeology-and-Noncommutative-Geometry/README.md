## Abstract

After embedding the objects quasifolds into the category {Diffeology}, we associate a C*-algebra with every atlas of any quasifold, and show how different atlases give Morita equivalent algebras. This builds a new bridge between diffeology and noncommutative geometry—beginning with the today classical example of the irrational torus—which associates a Morita class of C*-algebras with a diffeomorphic class of quasifolds.

## Significance of the Paper

This paper extends the structural bridge between **Noncommutative Geometry** and **Diffeology** established in the previous work on orbifolds to the more general class of **quasifolds**. Quasifolds, locally modeled on quotients $\RR^n/\Gamma$ where $\Gamma$ is a countable (possibly infinite) subgroup of the affine group, include fundamental examples like the irrational torus.

Key contributions include:
1.  **Quasifolds as Diffeologies:** Formal identification of quasifolds as a subcategory of diffeological spaces, clarifying the nature of smooth maps between them (which may not always lift equivariantly).
2.  **The Structure Groupoid:** Generalization of the structure groupoid construction to quasifolds, handling the technical challenges of dense orbits and infinite structure groups.
3.  **Morita Equivalence:** Proof that different atlases of a quasifold yield MRW-equivalent groupoids and thus **Morita equivalent** associated C*-algebras.

This work completes the picture for a broad class of singular spaces, showing that the diffeological invariant (the structure groupoid) perfectly captures the noncommutative invariant (the Morita class of the algebra), providing a rigorous geometric foundation for the study of spaces like the irrational torus and the $\QQ$-circle.
