## Abstract

This text presents the basics of Diffeology and the main domains: Homotopy, Fiber Bundles, Quotients, Singularities, Cartan-de Rham Calculus — which form the core of differential geometry — from the point of view of this theory. We show what makes diffeology special and relevant in regard to these traditional subjects.

## Significance: A Shift in Perspective

This paper articulates a fundamental shift in the perspective of geometric categorization. In traditional approaches, one often starts with a topological space and adds structure. In Diffeology, we start with a set that is already "dressed" with its own functional diffeology—whether it is a space of smooth functions, a quotient of a manifold, or a subset of a Euclidean space.

We then recognize this space as a member of a particular subcategory of diffeology (manifolds, orbifolds, manifolds with corners, quasifolds, etc.). This approach respects the intrinsic nature of the mathematical object. Because these objects are all included in the single category of Diffeology, they inherit all its categorical properties and constructions—smooth maps, diffeomorphism, homotopy, cohomology, etc.—without the need for heuristic, ad hoc extensions. This framework preserves and unifies the essence of Geometry.
