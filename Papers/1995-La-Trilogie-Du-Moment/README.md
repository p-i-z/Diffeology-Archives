## Summary

This paper presents a generalized theory of the moment map for any connected manifold equipped with a closed 2-form $\omega$ (presymplectic or symplectic). It establishes a unified framework—the "Trilogy"—linking three fundamental geometric objects:

1.  **The Central Extension:** The group of automorphisms of $\omega$ is centrally extended by the **torus of periods** $T_\omega = \mathbf{R}/P_\omega$.
2.  **The Moment Map:** The construction of the moment map $J$ and its **defect of equivariance** (Souriau's cocycle $\Theta$).
3.  **The Infinitesimal Extension:** The corresponding central extension of the Lie algebra of vector fields and its 2-cocycle $k_\omega$.

## Historical Significance: The Bridge to Diffeology

This work represents a pivotal moment in the development of the author's research program. While formulated within the language of symplectic geometry, it identifies the precise boundary where classical manifold theory breaks down and **Diffeology** becomes necessary.

Specifically, the construction relies on the **Torus of Periods** $T_\omega$.
*   If the form $\omega$ is integral (standard geometric quantization), $T_\omega$ is the circle $S^1$.
*   If the periods are irrational, $T_\omega$ becomes a dense quotient of $\mathbf{R}$ (an **irrational torus**).

In the category of manifolds, an irrational torus is a pathological object. However, in the category of **Diffeology**, it is a perfectly well-behaved group. This paper demonstrates that to solve the general problem of the moment map (e.g., for irrational symplectic forms), one must step outside the category of manifolds, paving the way for the full development of Diffeology.
