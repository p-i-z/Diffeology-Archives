## Abstract

We establish a first structural link between noncommutative geometry and diffeology, in the particular case of orbifolds. Precisely, we associate a *structure groupoid* with every atlas of a diffeological orbifold. We show that different atlases give equivalent groupoids, that generates strongly Morita equivalent C*-algebras, according to standards. Thus, diffeomorphisms translate naturally into Morita equivalences.

## Significance of the Paper

This paper initiates a structural bridge between two major frameworks for singular spaces: **Noncommutative Geometry** (Connes) and **Diffeology** (Souriau). Focusing on the case of orbifolds, it demonstrates how the diffeological perspective—starting from the smooth structure defined by plots—naturally leads to the algebraic invariants of noncommutative geometry.

Key contributions include:
1.  **The Structure Groupoid:** Construction of a diffeological groupoid associated with any atlas of an orbifold. This groupoid captures the local symmetries and singularities of the space.
2.  **Equivalence:** Proof that different atlases yield groupoids that are equivalent in the sense of Muhly-Renault-Williams (MRW-equivalence).
3.  **The Bridge:** By applying the standard groupoid C*-algebra construction to these structure groupoids, the paper establishes that diffeomorphic orbifolds have **Morita equivalent** associated C*-algebras.

This result validates the diffeological approach to orbifolds by showing it recovers the expected noncommutative invariants, paving the way for extending this dictionary to more general singular spaces like quasifolds.
