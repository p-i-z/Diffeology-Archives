## Abstract

We consider orbifolds as diffeological spaces. This gives rise to a natural notion of differentiable maps between orbifolds, making them into a subcategory of diffeology. We prove that the diffeological approach to orbifolds is equivalent to Satake's notion of a V-manifold and to Haefliger's notion of an orbifold. This follows from a lemma: a diffeomorphism (in the diffeological sense) of finite linear quotients lifts to an equivariant diffeomorphism.

## Context and History

This paper originated from a chance conversation during Patrick Iglesias-Zemmour's first visit to Israel. While waiting to meet with Yael Karshon, he was entertained by her student, Moshe Zadka. When asked about his work, Zadka mentioned he was studying orbifolds and attempted to explain the standard definition.

Finding the traditional explanation confusing, Iglesias-Zemmour interrupted and proposed a diffeological definition instead: "For me, an orbifold is a diffeological space that is locally diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n/\Gamma$, with $\Gamma$ being a finite linear subgroup."

As Zadka was unfamiliar with diffeology, Iglesias-Zemmour explained the concept to him. When Yael Karshon returned, she was excited by this new perspective. This enthusiasm is captured in the paper's acknowledgements, where she ironically notes:

> "I am grateful to Sue Tolman for convincing me, years ago, that I don't understand orbifolds."

This exchange—marking a "return" of diffeology to the forefront—sparked the collaboration that resulted in this paper.

## Significance: A Shift in Perspective

This paper marks a fundamental shift in perspective regarding the categorization of spaces in mathematics. We do not start with a pure set or a topological space to which structure is added; rather, we begin with a set that comes already "dressed" with its own diffeology—derived from its nature as a space of smooth functions, a quotient of a smooth manifold, or a subset of a Euclidean space. We then recognize this space as a member of a particular subcategory of diffeology—whether a manifold, an orbifold, a manifold with corners, or a quasifold etc. This approach respects the intrinsic diffeological structure given by the space's mathematical nature. 

And since they are included in the category of Diffeology, they inherit all its categorical properties and constructions: smooth maps, diffeomorphism, homotopy, cohomology etc. without needing heuristic ad hoc extensions. This preserves the unity of Geometry. It unifies the field rather than fragmenting it into different "theories" for every new type of space. This is the lesson of "Orbifolds as Diffeologies".
