## Abstract

We consider orbifolds as diffeological spaces. This gives rise to a natural notion of differentiable maps between orbifolds, making them into a subcategory of diffeology. We prove that the diffeological approach to orbifolds is equivalent to Satake's notion of a V-manifold and to Haefliger's notion of an orbifold. This follows from a lemma: a diffeomorphism (in the diffeological sense) of finite linear quotients lifts to an equivariant diffeomorphism.

## Context and History

This paper originated from a chance conversation during Patrick Iglesias-Zemmour's first visit to Israel. While waiting to meet with Yael Karshon, he was entertained by her student, Moshe Zadka. When asked about his work, Zadka mentioned he was studying orbifolds and attempted to explain the standard definition.

Finding the traditional explanation confusing, Iglesias-Zemmour interrupted and proposed a diffeological definition instead: "For me, an orbifold is a diffeological space that is locally diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n/\Gamma$, with $\Gamma$ being a finite linear subgroup."

As Zadka was unfamiliar with diffeology, Iglesias-Zemmour explained the concept to him. When Yael Karshon returned, she was excited by this new perspective. This enthusiasm is captured in the paper's acknowledgements, where she ironically notes:

> "I am grateful to Sue Tolman for convincing me, years ago, that I don't understand orbifolds."

This exchange—marking a "return" of diffeology to the forefront—sparked the collaboration that resulted in this paper.

This document has been "transmuted" from the original legacy source code to a modern format for the **Diffeology Archives**.

*   **Format:** Converted to `amsart` class with "ventilated prose" formatting.
*   **Encoding:** All legacy accent commands converted to UTF-8.
*   **Figures:** The original figures, which relied on the obsolete `eepic` package, have been completely redrawn using `TikZ`. The document is now self-contained and requires no external image files.
*   **Macros:** Specific macros (e.g., `\labell`, `\mathbbm`) have been preserved or mapped to modern equivalents to maintain the logic of the original proof.
