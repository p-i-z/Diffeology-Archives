## Abstract

We propose a Čech cohomology for diffeological spaces as the Hochschild cohomology of some characteristic gauge monoid. We then describe how this cohomology is connected with the De Rham cohomology, through a double-complex which we make explicit. We show that the first obstruction for the De Rham theorem in diffeology, which is the middle term of the exact sequence of low-degree terms of the associated spectral sequence, can be interpreted as some group of $(\mathbf{R},+)$ principal fiber bundles. That introduces a first characteristic class for diffeological spaces which does not exist for manifolds.

## Significance and Context

This paper addresses a fundamental question: "What happens to the De Rham theorem in diffeology?" While the De Rham homomorphism is an isomorphism for smooth manifolds, it fails to be so for many important diffeological spaces (such as the irrational torus).

The key result of this work is the identification and geometric interpretation of the obstruction to this isomorphism. By constructing a Čech-De Rham bicomplex, the paper reveals that the first obstruction is a group of $(\mathbf{R},+)$-principal fiber bundles (or "flows"). This leads to the definition of a **new, purely diffeological characteristic class** that has no equivalent in ordinary differential geometry.

This work opens the door to a deeper understanding of the cohomology of singular and infinite-dimensional spaces, a vast area of reflection in diffeology.

## Historical Note

This paper is a revised and formally published version of a preprint first written in French in 1988. It was recently published to provide a definitive reference for these long-standing results.
