## Abstract

The classical construction of the symplectic structure on the space of geodesic trajectories via Hamiltonian reduction fails in the pseudo-Riemannian setting due to a dimensional mismatch created by the null geodesics. This paper proposes a new, unified approach. We first construct the space of all geodesic trajectories, $\mathcal G_{\text{traj}}$, directly as the quotient of the space of geodesic curves by the affine reparametrization group. We then perform a symplectic analysis of the orbits of this group action, which reveals a key geometric distribution. To describe this distribution globally, we introduce a canonical object, the **conformal co-symplectic structure** $\sigma$, defined by pushing forward the conformal class of the inverse of the original symplectic form. We prove that the image of this structure coincides with the geometric distribution identified previously. On the subspace of time-like and space-like geodesics, this structure is non-degenerate and defines a conformal class of symplectic forms. On the null subspace, its image is a codimension-1 distribution that we prove is the canonical contact structure on the space of light rays.
